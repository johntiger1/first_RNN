The Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae model pathosystem is one of the most widely used systems to understand the mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and plant innate immunity. Several inoculation methods have been used to study plant-pathogen interactions in this model system. However, none of the methods reported to date are similar to those occurring in nature and amicable to large-scale mutant screens.

Results
In this study, we developed a rapid and reliable seedling flood-inoculation method based on young Arabidopsis seedlings grown on MS medium. This method has several advantages over conventional soil-grown plant inoculation assays, including a shorter growth and incubation period, ease of inoculation and handling, uniform infection and disease development, requires less growth chamber space and is suitable for high-throughput screens. In this study we demonstrated the efficacy of the Arabidopsis seedling assay to study 1) the virulence factors of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000, including type III protein secretion system (TTSS) and phytotoxin coronatine (COR); 2) the effector-triggered immunity; and 3) Arabidopsis mutants affected in salicylic acid (SA)- and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs)-mediated pathways. Furthermore, we applied this technique to study nonhost resistance (NHR) responses in Arabidopsis using nonhost pathogens, such as P. syringae pv. tabaci, pv. glycinea and pv. tomato T1, and confirmed the functional role of FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) in NHR.

Conclusions
The Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay provides a rapid, efficient and economical method for studying Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas interactions with minimal growth chamber space and time. This assay could also provide an excellent system for investigating the virulence mechanisms of P. syringae. Using this method, we demonstrated that FLS2 plays a critical role in conferring NHR against nonhost pathovars of P. syringae, but not to Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. This method is potentially ideal for high-throughput screening of both Arabidopsis and pathogen mutants.

Background
One of the model pathosystems for the study of plant-pathogen interactions is Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae interaction [1]. This model system has been widely used to understand a number of dynamic and complex molecular events in both resistance and susceptible interactions. In addition, P. syringae pvs. tomato and maculicola can infect and induce disease symptoms on Arabidopsis. P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000), which causes bacterial speck disease of tomato, has been used as a model pathogen for investigating the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions because of its pathogenicity on Arabidopsis [1,2]. The whole genome sequence of Pst DC3000 revealed that it has over 200 virulence-related genes [3]. One of the major class of virulence factors includes effector proteins that are delivered into the host through a type III protein secretion system (TTSS) to suppress plant immune responses, and also to facilitate disease development [4]. Pst DC3000 also produces non-proteinaceous virulence effectors, including coronatine (COR), which are crucial for pathogenesis. However, the virulence function of a large number of potential virulence effectors encoded by the Pst DC3000 genome and their mode of action is still unknown.

Arabidopsis model system has been especially crucial in investigation of the plant defense mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI), effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and systemic acquired resistance [5-7]. The plant pattern recognition receptors, including FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2), play an important role for FLS2-mediated PTI in the Arabidopsis-Pst DC3000 interactions. In addition to PTI, plants have evolved ETI via immune receptors (resistance proteins) to recognize corresponding avirulence effector proteins [6,8]. It has been shown that ETI and PTI use similar signaling pathways leading to defense responses [9,10]. Interestingly, pathogens have evolved virulence factors to target the hubs in plant immune system networks [11]. Therefore, to functionally dissect the dynamic interactions of plants with bacterial pathogens, there is a need for rapid, reliable pathogen assay that is suitable for high-throughput assays.

There are several reported methods to inoculate Arabidopsis with P. syringae including syringe pressure infiltration, vacuum infiltration, and spray- and dip-inoculation [1]. Syringe pressure infiltration is the most commonly used inoculation method, and the bacteria are forced into the apoplast using this method. However, in nature, P. syringae generally enters host tissues through natural openings such as stomata or wounds, and multiplies in the apoplast to cause disease [12]. In response to pathogen attack, Arabidopsis defense responses induce stomatal closure to limit the entry of bacteria after recognizing PAMPs from P. syringae [13]. When a COR-defective mutant was infiltrated into the apoplast by bypassing stomata-mediated defense, this mutant induced typical disease symptoms [13], suggesting that syringe pressure infiltration is not a suitable inoculation method for investigating the virulence mechanism of bacterial pathogens. Spray- or dip-inoculation methods have been used as a mimic for the natural infection process of P. syringae. However, these inoculation methods require high relative humidity to enable pathogens to enter and induce disease symptom development [1,14]. Spraying the abaxial leaf surfaces of the Arabidopsis rosette leaves without causing leaf damage is challenging, whereas the dip-inoculation of soil-grown plants is time consuming and requires the plants to be grown in pots with soil covered with nylon mesh. Moreover, the leaves inoculated with P. syringae using spray- and dip-inoculation methods do not show uniform disease symptoms because plant-pathogen interactions are often significantly affected by environmental factors and the developmental stage of the plants. Thus, the development of a reliable and robust inoculation method to study the interaction of Arabidopsis with P. syringae could reduce both time and space required.

Previously, we developed a simple tomato cotyledonary leaves-based assay to investigate Pst DC3000-tomato interactions and found that Pst DC3000 is a pathogen of tomato seedlings [15]. To establish an improved high-throughput assay to study the plant-bacterial interactions, in this study, we developed an improved, rapid and reliable seedling flood-inoculation method using Arabidopsis, a model plant that produces six to eight (true) rosette leaves within two-weeks, in standard Petri plates containing Phytagel supplemented with Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts. We further demonstrated that this method is suitable for the investigation of bacterial virulence mechanisms, plant nonhost resistance (NHR) and plant signaling pathways related to PTI and ETI.

Results and Discussion
Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay to study P. syringae-Arabidopsis interactions
To standardize the seedling assay and test whether Pst DC3000 multiplies and causes disease symptoms like in adult plants grown on soil, 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings (containing six to eight rosette leaves) grown on Phytagel plates were inoculated by flooding with a bacterial suspension until the plants were completely submerged in inoculum. The concentration of Phytagel and dryness of plates were critical for this assay. When the concentration of Phytagel was too low, the vitreous and wet plants were observed very often and were more sensitive to any pathogen inoculation. Seeds germinated on the plates made with 0.3% Phytagel produced seedlings that were the most suitable for the inoculation experiments.

First, to study the effect of inoculum concentration on symptom development, Arabidopsis plants were flood-inoculated with three different concentrations of Pst DC3000 [1 × 108, 2 × 107 and 5 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml)]. Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to 1 × 108 and 2 × 107 CFU/ml of bacteria showed severe disease symptoms including water-soaked lesions and chlorosis within 24-36 h and were dead by two to three days post-inoculation (dpi; data not shown). However, Arabidopsis plants inoculated with bacteria at 5 × 106 CFU/ml showed typical disease progression, showing chlorosis at 2 dpi and water-soaked lesions at 3 dpi (Figure 1A). However, at 5 dpi, the plants died due to severe disease (data not shown). The flood-inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings showed similar disease progression as that of soil-grown Arabidopsis plants inoculated with Pst DC3000 by vacuum infiltration at 1 × 106 CFU/ml bacterial concentration [1]. Thus, these results indicated that 5 × 106 CFU/ml bacterial concentration is suitable for further investigation of disease development.

Bacterial populations were quantified at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 dpi. Vertical bars indicate the standard errors for three independent experiments.

In addition to the disease symptom development, the virulence of Pst DC3000 is generally investigated by measuring bacterial growth in planta [1]. In flood-inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings, Pst DC3000 multiplied approximately 1, 000-fold within the 24 hpi and reached 100, 000-fold at 3 dpi (Figure 1B). These results were similar to the bacterial growth curves observed in vacuum-infiltrated Arabidopsis mature leaves at 1 × 106 CFU/ml [1]. Furthermore, Pst DC3000 reached higher titer in seedling flood-inoculation assay compared to dip-inoculated leaves of soil-grown, 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants (Figure 1B; [14]). These results suggest that Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay is a reliable method to study Pst DC3000 disease progression and to evaluate in planta bacterial growth.

Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay is suitable to study the virulence mutants of Pseudomonas syringae
TTSS is a key virulence component of P. syringae because hrp/hrc mutants that block TTSS completely eliminate the virulence against susceptible Arabidopsis plants [16]. Furthermore, previous studies using COR-defective (COR-) mutants have demonstrated that COR enables Pst DC3000 to multiply and reach higher population densities in planta, and result in the development of larger lesions [12,14,17-21]. We used well characterized virulence mutants, including hrcC mutant [16] and DB29 as COR-d mutant [14] to study the utility of the Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay for investigating the virulence factors of Pst DC3000. Pst DC3000 caused typical water-soaked symptoms with severe chlorosis on Arabidopsis seedlings at 3 dpi (Figure 2A). However, water-soaked symptoms and chlorosis were not observed on DB29- and hrcC-inoculated seedlings, and they appeared healthy (Figure 2A). Consistent with disease development, the bacterial populations of DB29 and hrcC mutants were ~100-fold lower compared to Pst DC3000 (Figure 2B). Furthermore, a higher percentage of ion leakage (an indicator of disease-associated cell death) was observed in Arabidopsis seedlings inoculated with Pst DC3000 compared with those inoculated with DB29 or hrcC mutant (Figure 2C). These results indicate that both COR and TTSS have important roles in the bacterial multiplication, persistence and disease symptom development of Pst DC3000 in Arabidopsis seedlings and is consistent with the results obtained from soil-grown Arabidopsis plants [14,18,20]. These results further confirmed that the Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay is suitable for analyzing virulence mutants of Pst DC3000.

Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay to study host signal pathways leading to disease development
Arabidopsis coronatine insensitive 1 (coi1) mutant demonstrated a role for jasmonate (JA)-mediated signaling pathway in defense against insects and necrotrophic pathogens [22,23]. COI1 encodes an F-box protein that functions as a receptor of COR and JA-isoleucine, and is considered a master regulator of the JA-mediated signaling pathway [22-27]. The coi1 mutant plants have been shown to be highly resistant to COR-producing P. syringae, including Pst DC3000 and P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 (Psm ES4326), with significant reduction of bacterial multiplication and disease symptom development [28,29]. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated a role for a suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1 (SGT1) in COR-induced chlorosis and Pst DC3000-induced disease development [30].

To evaluate the utility of the Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay for studying host signaling pathways related to Pst DC3000- and Psm ES4326-induced disease susceptibility, we inoculated Arabidopsis coi1 and sgt1b (eta3) mutants along with the wild-type Col-0 with Pst DC3000 and Psm ES4326 using the flood-inoculation method. Both Pst DC3000 and Psm ES4326 caused typical water-soaked lesions with severe chlorosis on Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings at 3 dpi (Figure 3A). On the other hand, coi1 mutant seedlings inoculated with both pathogens appeared healthy without any water-soaked lesions or chlorosis (Figure 3A). In coi1 mutant seedlings, the bacterial populations of Pst DC3000 and Psm ES4326 were significantly lower compared to the wild-type Col-0 (Figures 3B and 3C). Consistent with our previous study [30], disease-associated water-soaked lesions and chlorosis were also significantly reduced in the eta3 mutant at 3 dpi with both the pathogens tested (Figure 3A). However, the bacterial populations of both pathogens were not different between wild-type and eta3 mutant (Figures 3B and 3C). Together, these results suggested that seedling flood-inoculation assay is suitable to further investigate the host signaling pathways leading to disease development in Arabidopsis.

Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay to study effector-triggered immunity
The Arabidopsis-P. syringae model system has been widely used to study ETI [1]. To evaluate the utility of the Arabidopsis seedling-flood inoculation assay for studying ETI, we inoculated Arabidopsis Col-0 that carries a resistance (R) gene RPS2 that can recognize AvrRpt2 with Pst DC3000 or Pst DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2 at high (5 × 106 CFU/ml) and low (1 × 105 CFU/ml) bacterial cell densities by flood inoculation. At high inoculum concentration, Pst DC3000 caused typical chlorosis on Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0) seedlings at 2 dpi (Figure 4A). On the other hand, Arabidopsis seedlings inoculated with Pst DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2 showed HR as early as 1 dpi (Figure 4A inset) and complete cell death due to HR within 2 dpi (Figure 4A). At low inoculum concentration (1 × 105 CFU/ml), Pst DC3000 caused disease-associated water-soaked lesions and chlorosis at 4 dpi, whereas the seedlings inoculated with Pst DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2 appeared healthy (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the bacterial populations of Pst DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2 were significantly lower compared to those of Pst DC3000 (Figure 4C). Together, these results confirmed that Arabidopsis seedlings showed typical gene-for-gene mediated resistance responses and seedling-flood inoculation assay is suitable for analyzing ETI.

Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay confirmed a role for FLS2 in nonhost bacterial resistance
After confirming the utility of the Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation method for identifying bacterial virulent mutants and plant mutants defective in disease signaling pathways, we applied the seedling flood-inoculation method to investigate the mechanisms of NHR in Arabidopsis. NHR is defined as a form of resistance exhibited by an entire plant species to a particular microbial pathogen and is the most common and durable form of resistance [31]. However, we know very little about various genes that regulate NHR [32]. Furthermore, the functional overlap between resistance mediated by ETI, PTI and NHR is not clear. We challenged Arabidopsis seedlings with nonhost bacterial pathogens including P. syringae pv. tabaci (Psta), pv. glycinea (Psg), pv. tomato T1 (Pst T1) and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) at high (5 × 107 CFU/ml) and low (5 × 106 CFU/ml) bacterial cell densities by flood inoculation. At high inoculum concentration, Psta, Psg and Pst T1, but not Xcv, induced a hypersensitive response (HR) cell death within 24 hpi on Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings (Figure 5A). Furthermore, a higher percentage of ion leakage (an indicator of cell death) was observed in Psta-, Psg- and Pst T1-inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings when compared to Xcv- and mock-inoculated seedlings (Figure 5B).

Phenotypes of Arabidopsis seedlings flood-inoculated with nonhost pathogens including Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci (Psta), Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea (Psg), Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato T1 (Pst T1) and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) at a concentration of 5 × 107 or 5 × 106 CFU/ml. Photographs were taken at 1 or 3 dpi. B. Ion leakage from Arabidopsis seedlings flooded with water (mock) or Psta, Psg, Pst T1 or Xcv at high bacterial density (5 × 107 CFU/ml) at 1 dpi. Bars show the percentage of total ions. C. Bacterial populations of Pst DC3000, Psta, Psg, Pst T1 or Xcv in Arabidopsis were quantified at 0 and 3 dpi. Vertical bars indicate the standard errors for three independent experiments.

At low inoculum concentrations (5 × 106 CFU/ml), none of the nonhost pathogens tested showed obvious symptoms on Arabidopsis plants (Figure 5A). In addition, the bacterial populations of Psta, Psg, Pst T1 and Xcv at low inoculum concentration were significantly lower compared to Pst DC3000 at 3 dpi (Figure 5C). Thus, these results indicate that Arabidopsis seedlings show typical NHR against Psta, Psg, Pst T1 and Xcv.

Interestingly, Psta induced stronger HR cell death in Arabidopsis than other nonhost pathogens tested (Figures 5A and 5B). It has been reported that nonhost plants recognize flagellin protein from Psta to induce HR cell death to limit bacterial growth via NHR [33-36]. Furthermore, TTSS was also shown to have a role in inducing HR cell death in Arabidopsis-Psta interactions [37]. To investigate whether flagellin or effector proteins can induce HR cell death using an Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay, we inoculated Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings with flagellin- and TTSS-defective mutants of Psta at 5 × 107 CFU/ml. Psta induced HR cell death within 24 hpi on Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings, whereas Psta ΔfliC- and ΔhrcC-inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings did not show any visible HR cell death (Figure 6A). Consistent with the cell death, a higher percentage of ion leakage was observed in Psta-inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings when compared to Psta ΔfliC- and ΔhrcC-inoculated seedlings (Figure 6B), suggesting that flagellin and TTSS are essential for the induction of HR cell death in Arabidopsis-Psta interactions.

HR of Arabidopsis seedlings flood-inoculated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci wild-type (Psta), Psta flagellin-defective mutant (Psta ΔfliC) and Psta type III secretion defective mutant (Psta ΔhrcC) at a concentration of 5 × 107 CFU/ml. Photographs were taken at 1 dpi. B. Ion leakage from Arabidopsis seedlings flooded with water (mock) or Psta (WT) or Psta ΔfliC or Psta ΔhrcC at 1 dpi. Bars show the percentage of total ions.

Previous studies also demonstrated that flagellin-defective mutants of Psta evaded recognition by the nonhost plants and multiplied in tomato and Arabidopsis [33-35]. FLS2 was reported to have a role in NHR in N. benthamiana [38]. However, these studies have not convincingly demonstrated the precise role of flagellin perception as a component of NHR. Therefore, we inoculated Arabidopsis mutants defective in flagellin perception, fls2, and a SA biosynthetic mutant, salicylic acid induction deficient 2 (sid2), with nonhost pathogens Psta, Psg, Pst T1 and Xcv at 5 × 106 CFU/ml. Interestingly, only Psta induced disease-like symptoms associated with tissue chlorosis on fls2 and sid2 mutants (Figure 7). Furthermore, fls2 and sid2 supported higher in planta bacterial growth of nonhost pathogen Psta (Figure 8A), indicating the importance of flagellin-triggered immunity and the SA-mediated signaling pathway leading to NHR against Psta. It is important to note that the Psta flagellin-defective mutant caused disease-like symptoms in nonhost plants [33-35]. Taken together, these results suggest that Psta may have potential virulence mechanisms to cause disease once the NHR is compromised in these mutants. Interestingly, although Psg and Pst T1 failed to show any symptoms on fls2 and sid2 mutant seedlings, they supported higher levels of bacterial growth (Figures 8B, C), whereas Xcv failed to show any symptoms and did not multiply to higher levels in fls2 and sid2 mutant seedlings (Figure 8D). These results suggest that not all the nonhost pathogens have mechanisms to effectively deploy virulence factors (effectors or toxins) to cause disease even in the absence of the first layer of PTI mediated by FLS2 and NHR to Xcv may be mediated by the perception of PAMPs other than flagellin. It was reported that FLS2 did not detect all flagellin proteins among Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) strains, and a Val-43/Asp polymorphism in flg22 region determined the PAMP activity of the Xcc flagellin protein [39]. It is interesting to note that the Xcv flagellin protein (GenBank accession numbers: CAJ23699.1 and YP_363753.1) represents a mutation in the Val-43 in the flg22 region (QQLSSGKRITSFAVDAAGGAIA) which may be undetectable by FLS2 in Arabidopsis [40].

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation assay is a rapid and reliable assay for the study of interactions between P. syringae and Arabidopsis. In principle, we showed that this method should be suitable for investigating dynamic and complex molecular events, such as signaling pathways in both resistance and susceptible interactions. This assay could also provide an excellent system for investigating the virulence mechanisms of P. syringae. Due to high reliability and minimal space, time and budget requirements, this inoculation method is ideal for the high-throughput survey of Arabidopsis mutants altered in host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, we also expect that this method will help to carry out pathogen mutant screens to elucidate the virulence mechanisms of phytopathogens that are pathogenic on Arabidopsis and especially beneficial for labs that have limited plant growth facilities.

Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Colombia (Col-0) was used as a wild-type plant in this study. The male sterile coi1-17 line [41] was obtained from Dr. Barbara Kunkel (Washington University, St. Louis MO) and maintained as a heterozygous stock. The homozygous coi1-17 line was selected by growing the seeds from segregating lines on one-half Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) containing 10 μM methyl jasmonate (MeJA; Bedoukian Research Inc., Danbury, CT, U.S.A.) for seven days, and then transferring to one-half MS medium without MeJA. The sid2-2 (eds16) line [42,43] was obtained from Dr. Frederick Ausubel (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). The fls2 line [36] was obtained from Dr. Yuki Ichinose (Okayama University, Okayama, Japan).

Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized using bleach. In brief, 100-200 seeds were incubated with 70% ethanol for 5 min in a microcentrifuge tube and then incubated with 20% (v/v) commercial bleach containing 6% sodium hypochlorite (Clorox Co., Oakland, CA) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). After surface sterilization, seeds were washed with sterile distilled H2O at least four times and germinated on one-half strength MS medium containing Gamborg vitamins (PhytoTechnologies Laboratories, Shawnee Mission, KS, U.S.A.) solidified with 0.3% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) in deep Petri plates (100 mm × 25 mm). The MS plates were dried overnight in the hood with closed lid before transferring the surface-sterilized seeds. The MS plates with seeds were kept for two days at 4°C to break the dormancy and were further incubated at 24°C with a light intensity of 150-200 μE m-2 sec-1 and a 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod, and the seedlings, two weeks post-germination, were used for pathogen assays.

Bacterial strains
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) [3] and P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 (Psm ES4326) [29] were used as pathogenic strains on Arabidopsis. The hrcC mutant defective in type III secretion [16] and a COR-defective mutant, DB29 [14], were used as virulence mutants of Pst DC3000. Pst DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2 [44] was used as an avirulent or incompatible pathogen to study ETI. Nonhost pathogens P. syringae pv. tabaci 6605 (Psta) [45], pv. glycinea race 4 (Psg) [46], pv. tomato T1 (Pst T1) [47] and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) [40] were used to study NHR. Psta ΔfliC mutant defective in flagellin [35] and the ΔhrcC mutant defective in type III secretion [48] were used to study HR cell death. P. syringae were grown at 28°C on mannitol-glutamate (MG) medium [49] containing appropriate antibiotics as needed in the following concentrations (μg ml-1): rifampicin, 50; kanamycin, 25; chloramphenicol, 25; and spectinomycin, 25, for 36-48 h. Xcv was grown at 28°C on Luria-Bertani (LB) media. Prior to inoculation, bacteria were suspended in sterile distilled H2O and bacterial cell densities (OD600) were measured using a Jenway 6320D spectrophotometer (Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK)

Seedling flood-inoculation method
A flood-inoculation method that we have previously developed to infect the cotyledonary leaves of tomato [15] was modified to develop an Arabidopsis seedling flood-inoculation technique with reproducible disease symptoms. To perform uniform inoculation, 40 ml of bacterial suspension made in sterile distilled H2O containing 0.025% Silwet L-77 (OSI Specialties Inc., Danbury, CT, U.S.A.) was dispensed into the plate containing 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings, and the plates were incubated for 2-3 min at room temperature. After the bacterial suspension was removed by decantation, plates containing inoculated plants were sealed with 3 M Micropore 2.5 cm surgical tape (3 M, St. Paul, MN, U.S.A.) and incubated at 24°C with a light intensity of 150-200 μE m-2 sec-1 and a 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod. Symptom development was observed at 1 and 3 dpi. In each experiment, 16 plants were evaluated, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.

To determine the bacterial growth in Arabidopsis leaves, we measured internal bacterial population at several time points (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 dpi). Internal bacterial populations were evaluated from four biological replicates and each replicate represented a pooled sample of four independent seedlings from a single experiment grown in a single Petri-dish. Inoculated seedlings were collected by cutting the hypocotyls to separate the above agar parts (whole rosette) from the Phytagel plate, and the total weight of inoculated seedlings was measured. After measurement of the seedlings' weight, the seedlings were surface-sterilized with 5% H2O2 for 3 min. After washing three times with sterile distilled water, a pooled sample of four seedling were homogenized in 10 mL sterile distilled water using a mortar and pestle, and diluted samples were plated onto MG or LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Two days after plating of diluted samples, the bacterial colony forming units (CFU) were counted using proper diluted samples. The CFU was normalized as CFU/mg using total weight of inoculated seedlings. Bacterial populations were evaluated in three independent experiments. 

Detection of cell death
HR and disease-associated cell death were estimated by measuring ion leakage from five independent seedlings treated with water (mock) or inoculated with P. syringae and incubated for two days at 24°C with a light intensity of 150-200 μE m-2 sec-1 and a 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod as described previously [50]. Inoculated seedlings (whole rosette) were collected by cutting the hypocotyls at the interface of the Phytagel plate and then gently agitated in 30 ml of distilled water for 3 h, and the leachates were measured using an ion conductivity meter (Orion555A, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Plants were then autoclaved for 20 min to kill the cells and release total ions into the medium. Values relative to the whole ion content after autoclaving were used to express the percent ion leakage.

==== Body
Introduction
Very preterm infants are at high risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. By school age, 30-50% of them exhibit cognitive impairment [1,2]. Many preterm infants develop functional deficits even in the absence of visible brain injury on cranial ultrasound. While brain MRI is more sensitive than cranial ultrasound, the full significance of certain imaging findings remains in question. In particular, the significance of white matter signal abnormality (WMSA) on conventional T2-weighted MRI at around term-equivalent age (TEA) [3] as a predictor of later cognitive impairment remains unclear [4]. 

A few studies with neurodevelopmental follow-up have observed a significant negative association between WMSA and developmental quotient at 18 months corrected age [5,6] and intelligence quotient at 9 years of age [7]. Kidokoro et al. [4] also found a significant association with cognitive scores but only in preterm infants with WMSA severe enough to render the periventricular crossroads regions invisible. Conversely, others have not observed an association with any impairment [8-11]. Considering its high incidence of up to 75% [3], WMSA may represent a prematurity-related developmental phenomenon. Multiple crossing fibers and a high content of hydrophilic extracellular matrix in anterior and posterior periventricular white matter regions may contribute to the high signal intensity observed on T2-weighted MRI and lower anisotropy on diffusion MRI [12,13]. 

The limited progress in resolving the above question can partly be attributed to the use of conventional qualitative MRI readings. Such an approach remains subjective and lacks sufficient reliability for accurate and reproducible WMSA diagnosis [14] and may therefore contribute to suboptimal neurodevelopmental outcome prediction. The advantages of quantitative over qualitative diagnostic approaches have been widely acknowledged and demonstrated [6,15-18]. 

For T2-weighted sequences without fluid attenuation, the signal intensity distribution of WMSA greatly overlaps with that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), making the distinction between them difficult [18,19]. To overcome this known difficulty, we propose a probabilistic atlas-guided WMSA detection and quantification method. In the context of this work, we define a probabilistic atlas, as a pairing of anatomy template (an averaged anatomy image from a set of normalized anatomy images in common reference space) and its corresponding tissue probability maps (averaged gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and CSF segmentations from a set of normalized manual segmentations in common reference space). The atlas that embeds tissue distributions (i.e. encodes shapes, locations and geometrical proportion of anatomical structures) is utilized to guide WMSA detections. 

Atlas-guided analysis methods are usually characterized by how the atlases are generated and how the knowledge regarding atlases can be carried forward to target images. The atlas can be constructed using manual/semiautomatic/automatic segmentations of an individual or a group of individuals [20-27]. Our proposed atlas is constructed using a set of manual parcellations of brains, which are optimal and reproducible. We endeavor to reduce bias toward a specific subject and characterize the variability of a similar age population (extremely low birth weight [ELBW, birth weight ≤1000 g] infants) by utilizing anatomical averaging. We are aware of the differences in performance resulting from different spatial normalization procedures despite use of the same atlas and subject [28]. Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) [29] is well suited to our needs for forward warping an individual subject to an atlas as well as backward warping the atlas to the same subject. Due to the reciprocal nature of the LDDMM, the transformation can be reliably accomplished in either direction [30,31]. 

 In this work, we constructed a probabilistic brain atlas, exclusively for very preterm infants and then guided with this atlas, we proposed a fully automated WMSA detection and quantification method using clinically available T2-weighted images. Computer simulations and experiments on clinical MRI data presented very high detection accuracy. Finally, in a prospective cohort of ELBW infants, we demonstrated a significant correlation between objectively quantified WMSA volumes and language and cognitive developmental scores on the third edition of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at two years of age. 

Methods
Ethics Statement
The Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital (CMHH) and The University of Texas Medical School at Houston joint institutional review board (IRB) approved the study. Written informed consent for each infant was obtained prior to enrollment in the study. The consent was approved by IRB and signed by each subject's parent or guardian prior to enrollment and participation in the study.

Subjects
The study population was derived from a cohort of 50 ELBW infants without any major congenital anomalies, cared for in the NICU of Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital from 2007 to 2009. Their mean (standard deviation [SD]) gestational age was 25.5 (1.6) with a range of 23 to 30.1 weeks; birth weight was 750.8 (143.1) grams with a range of 468 to 1000 grams; and the postmenstrual age at MRI was 38.7 (2.3) with a range of 34.1 to 43.9 weeks. Nineteen MRI scans were randomly selected for atlas construction from the cohort study. Their mean (SD) gestational age was 25.8 (1.8) with a range of 23.4 to 30 weeks; birth weight was 724.2 (148.4) grams with a range of 489 to 1000 grams; and post-menstrual age at MRI was 38.1 (2.1) weeks with range of 34.1 to 41.7 weeks. 

MRI acquisition
All infants were imaged with a 3 T Philips scanner using a dual-echo fast-spin-echo sequence with use of an eight-channel SENSE-compatible phased array receive head coil. The imaging parameters used were: TE1 = 8.75ms; TE2 = 175 ms; TR = 10,000 ms; flip angle = 90°; FOV = 180×180 mm2; the imaging matrix = 256×256 mm2; slice thickness = 2 mm. In this study, T2-weighted images (corresponds to TE2) were used to construct the atlas and perform the analysis. All infants were transported to the MRI scanner by an experienced neonatal transport nurse after feeding, swaddling and placement of silicone ear plugs (E.A.R. Inc., Boulder, CO) and Natus MiniMuffs (Natus Medical Inc., San Carlos, CA) to facilitate natural sleep and attenuate MRI noise. Sedation was not used for any of the cases. All scans were completed under the supervision of a neonatal research nurse and a neonatologist experienced in neonatal MRI. All MRI scans were read by a neuroradiologist using a standardized reporting tool.

Very preterm infant probabilistic atlas creation
All 19 ELBW infants randomly chosen for the atlas creation, had varying degrees of WMSA ranging from only in the frontal and/or occipital periventricular white matter up to signal abnormalities covering two-thirds of the cerebral WM. The procedures for atlas creation were similar to the general concept for creating an adult/neonatal group-averaged atlas: 1. Extrameningeal tissues were manually stripped and brain tissues (CSF, WM and GM) were manually parcellated using ANALYZE 8.1 software (Biomedical Imaging Resource, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), as previously described in detail in [19]; 2. T2-weighted images and tissue parcellation maps were then resliced to 1 mm isotropic resolution; 3. Out of all candidates, a representative single-subject image with the brain size/shape fitted to general very preterm infant brains at TEA was selected; 4. Each subject scan was non-linearly normalized to the representative subject using LDDMM to create an averaged anatomy image, which worked as a tentative template for the next step; 5. Each subject was again nonlinearly normalized to the tentative template using LDDMM to create the desired averaged anatomy template; and 6. The resultant nonlinear transformation matrices were applied to the corresponding manual parcellation maps to create the averaged tissue probability maps. All normalization was performed using DiffeoMap (www.mristudio.org, Johns Hopkins University). The atlas is available to interested researchers upon request.

WMSA regions
When it was first reported in preterm neonates [3], hyperintense WMSA was called diffuse excessive high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and defined as “excessive” high signal intensity within the periventricular or subcortical WM that was not limited to the normal distribution of periventricular crossroads (also called layers, anterior caps, and posterior arrowheads). However, the boundaries of these crossroads regions are not well defined. Furthermore, diffusion abnormalities within high signal intensity regions of the centrum semiovale appear to be pathologic and associated with lower developmental quotient [6]. Therefore, in addition to subcortical WM and centrum semiovale, we included anterior and posterior periventricular WM in the regions of our interest. In this work, we will investigate the relationship of outcomes with WMSA regional volumes defined at level of the 1. Entire WM; 2. Periventricular WM – on slices beginning with the first appearance of the frontal horns and ending with the last images of the midbody of the lateral ventricles; and 3. Centrum semiovale – defined as the two axial slices above the last slice of the midbody of the lateral ventricles.

Voxels with values greater than or equal to α SD above the mean of cerebral tissues (WM and GM) were defined to be WMSA, following the same strategy used in [18]. The cut-off threshold α was determined using computer simulations. Simulated preterm infant T2-weighted brain images with isotropic spatial resolution were constructed based on a normal anatomical model [32,33] combined with manually drawn synthetic WMSA regions (as shown in the first column in Figure 1.) by a neonatologist with more than a decade of experience in perinatal brain injury and MRI research. In contrast to adult brains, the intensity of WM is higher than that of GM. Heuristically, we set the mean values of CSF, WM, GM and WMSA to be 400, 260, 190 and 340 respectively. Different levels of Rician noise and multiplicative slowly-varying field of intensity non-uniformity (INU) with a complex shape and range of 0.9 to 1.1 (20% level) were imposed. Without loss of generality, we minimized the possible errors that spatial normalizations may cause by not varying brain sizes/shapes of each random Monte Carlo realization. WMSA detections using various α ranging from 1 to 1.8 were conducted and the one that facilitated maximum accuracy rates was considered to be optimal, irrespective of the level of noise, the optimal α was 1.4.

 Images at three mid-axial levels show, from left to right: noise-free images with manually drawn WMSA regions in yellow (ground truth); addition of Rician noise (SNR = 15) and INU (20% level); and WMSA detection by our proposed method marked in yellow. 

Cerebral tissue segmentation is achieved by incorporating membership function from unified segmentation [34] with the anatomical information obtained by adapting very preterm infant probabilistic brain atlas to fit individual brain. More specifically, let S be a set of voxels/locations in a brain image and xi (i∈S) be the corresponding intensities. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to segment images into different tissue regions (background, WM, GM, and CSF), say ωj, j = 1 to 4. We denote μunified(ωj|xi) as membership function derived using the generative unified model provided in SPM (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Briefly, unified tissue segmentation requires the images to be normalized with tissue probability maps (refer to the section of very preterm infant probabilistic atlas creation). Spatial normalization is through non-linear deformation, which is modelled with a linear combination of non-linear 3D discrete cosine transforms basis functions. After normalization, these maps represent the prior probability of different tissue classes being found at each location in an image. Bayes rule can then be used to combine these priors with tissue type probabilities derived from voxel intensities to provide the posterior probability. In this unified segmentation model, intensity inhomogeneity correction was included in the mixture of Gaussian by extra parameters that account for smooth intensity variations. Partial volume artifact was controlled by assuming that the intensity distribution of each class may or may not be Gaussian (i.e. mixture of Gaussians). Typical numbers of Gaussians are three for grey matter and two for white matter, two for CSF and five for everything else.

We then propose to include an atlas-guided anatomy mislabelling correction into the model via individual tissue probability maps, μatlas(ωj|xi), whose generation is illustrated in a flowchart shown in Figure 2. The final segmentation μij is determined by a joint probabilistic membership function,

A target individual anatomy was first normalized to the reference space formed by the very preterm probabilistic atlas using LDDMM and the resultant transformation matrix was saved. The inverse transformation matric was applied to the tissue probability maps to create the desired target individual tissue probability maps.

Quantitatively, automated detection showed very high Dice similarity index values (left) and low false detection rates (right) at each noise level with ground truth. 

Validation
By superimposing ground-truth and automated detections, four different pixel categories are generated: a (the number of correct detections that a voxel is negative), b (the number of incorrect detections that a voxel is positive), c (the number of incorrect detections that a voxel is negative), and d (the number of correct detections that a voxel is positive). Seven metrics are used: true positive rate = d / (c + d); true negative rate = a / (a + b); false positive rate = b / (a + b); false negative rate = c / (c + d); precision = d / (b + d); accuracy = (a + d) / (a + b + c + d) and Dice = (2 × precision × true positive) / (precision + true positive) [45].

Language and cognitive developmental outcomes
All discharged ELBW infants were administered a standardized Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (BSID-III) at 2 years of age. One infant died after discharge. Forty-seven of the remaining 49 infants (96%) returned for follow-up. However nine of these infants had to be excluded: seven exhibited behavioral problems and could not be tested for one or both Bayley scores; one infant had excessive motion artifacts; and one infant had severe encephalomalacia. Therefore, 38 ELBW infants were available for full analyses. The BSID-III language and cognitive subtests (on a scale of 50 to 150, with a mean of 100 and 150 indicating the most advanced development) were administered by a masked, certified examiner. All examiners are blinded to imaging findings during assessment. Bayley motor and behavioral scales were not administered to study infants. Standardized motor function was tested but was not included in our analyses because of the low incidence of cerebral palsy and resulting inadequate study power. 

Statistical analysis
The relationships between continuous variables of objectively quantified WMSA volumes vs. BSID-III language and WMSA volumes vs. BSID-III cognitive scores were identified using both Pearson correlation and simple linear regression analyses. Assumptions of both analyses were tested and met. 

We use Pearson correlation coefficient r to measure the linear correlation between the two variables, giving a value between 1 and −1, where 1 is total positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and −1 is negative correlation. In addition, we use linear regression to model the relationship between the two variables by fitting a linear equation. A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where b is the slope of the line and a is the intercept. When b = 1 and a = 0, a perfect agreement can be said to exist between two variables. Coefficient of determination, denoted R2 (0≤R2 ≤1) is used to describe how well the regression line fits the observed data. The larger the R2, the better the fit.

In bivariate analyses, we tested the influence of sex, gestational age, and postmenstrual age at MRI scan, one at a time with WMSA volume and associated them with cognitive and language scores. Two-sided P values of <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons [46].

Results
Simulations
The proposed method was first validated on simulated preterm infant brains with known ground-truth (manually drawn WMSA). Qualitatively, Figure 1 shows that the WMSA detection and quantification results have strong agreement with the ground truth. In addition, quantitative comparisons displayed in Figure 3 show very high similarity index values and low false detection rates at each signal-to-noise (SNR, which is the mean signal intensity divided by the standard deviation of the noise) level.

In vivo very preterm data
Skull stripping was performed using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) [35]. An experienced neonatologist visually inspected the detection results. Representative images from one ELBW infant with WMSA detection highlighted in red are presented in Figure 4. The automated WMSA detection closely approximated the visually apparent signal abnormalities.

R2 denotes linear regression’s coefficient of determination and r denotes Pearson correlation coefficient. Larger WMSA volumes correspond with both lower cognitive and language scores. WMSA regional volume within centrum semiovale is a better predictor of Bayley scores than that within the periventricular WM regions.

WMSA volume as a predictor of language and cognitive outcomes
WMSA volume was quantified by taking the product of total number of positive voxels in the detected binary mask by the volume of each voxel. The mean (SD) age at follow-up of our cohort was 23.7 (2.9) months (20.0 [2.8] months corrected age). The cohort BSID-III language scores had a mean of 94.3 and a standard deviation of 14.0; cognitive scores had a mean of 88.7 and a standard deviation of 17.4. Correlational statistical analyses showed that BSID-III language and cognitive scores were significantly (P value < 0.05) correlated with total WMSA volume as well as WMSA within the sub-regions of WM (Figure 5). WMSA at the level of the centrum semiovale exhibited the strongest linear correlation with Bayley scores, while WM in the periventricular crossroads exhibited the weakest correlation. These relationships modeled by linear regression are also plotted in Figure 5. In bivariate analyses, sex, gestational age, and postmenstrual age at MRI scan were not significant and exerted minimal influence on the beta coefficients.

Discussions
Accurate and reproducible quantification of WMSA is critical for determining its developmental significance and potentially identifying high-risk preterm infants that may benefit from neuroprotective and early intervention therapies. In this paper, we present a fully automated atlas-guided method to detect and quantify WMSA on conventional T2-weighted imaging. Atlas-guided anatomic information was incorporated with unified segmentation and the relative importance of both components was controlled by two parameters. We assigned equal weights to both components, recognizing that different weighting would likely produce different results. Intuitively, if the knowledge carried by an atlas can be precisely forwarded to a target, μatlas should be weighted heavily; otherwise, one should consider weighing μspm heavily. Importantly, this approach likely contributed to our finding a significant association between WMSA volume and short-term standardized measures of language and cognitive development in ELBW infants.

Several studies have found that adult atlases do not form a suitable reference space for children and neonates, due to the considerable differences in size, geometrical proportions and brain tissue properties [36-39]. However, there are no studies on how well the atlases of full term neonates match very preterm infants, and vice versa. As compared to healthy term newborns, the brains of very preterm infants on TEA MRI frequently exhibit WMSA, delayed cortical maturation, and globally smaller structural and tissue volumes, even in the absence of signs of overt perinatal brain injury [40]. With more subjects being added to our current cohort study, this would be an interesting topic to explore. It is also worth noting that a dynamically time-varying atlas with dense duration coverage may more accurately reflect the fast rate of brain structure changes during the first few months of life [26,27,41-44]. 

Our studies were performed on unsedated infants who typically fall asleep after being fed and swaddled. The ability to now use conventional T2-weighted over multiple echo weighted imaging helps reduce scan time, resulting in less motion artifacts and need for sedation. Use of parallel imaging techniques, as used in our study, is also helping greatly in this regard. These innovations will facilitate larger multicenter imaging studies in very preterm infants and aid in definitively establishing the role of advanced brain MRI in this vulnerable population. Once more cases can be added to our preterm atlas, additional refinements such as localization of WMSA will be necessary to fully understand the developmental significance of WM hyperintensities in periventricular crossroads regions versus subcortical or centrum semiovale regions [12,13].

In our cohort of very preterm infants, we demonstrated automatically detected WMSA volume on TEA MRI to be a significant predictor of cognitive and language development at 2 years of age. Prior efforts to correlate WMSA with cognitive outcomes may have failed due to the low reliability of diagnosing WMSA qualitatively [9,14]. Our findings support the use of objective automated techniques to accurately quantify the lesion burden in perinatal-neonatal brain injury. Furthermore, lesion localization appears important in distinguishing developmentally normal from pathologic signal abnormalities, as observed in the periventricular crossroads and centrum semiovale regions, respectively. This also facilitates improved outcome prediction. 

The volume of WMSA in the centrum semiovale was the strongest predictor of Bayley scores, particularly language scores. This is consistent with findings from Krishnan et al. [6], who reported a significant correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient values in the centrum semiovale on TEA diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and developmental quotient at 2 years corrected age. In a related study from this same cohort [47], we measured DTI microstructural measures in the centrum semiovale and found these to be independent predictors of cognitive/language scores at age 2. Our findings are also consistent with several other studies that found a relationship between WMSA and cognitive outcomes [4,5,7,48] but not all studies [8-11]. Similar to our study, both prior studies that used a quantitative measure of WMSA found a significant correlation with cognitive scores [6,48] but only a fraction of the studies that used a subjective diagnosis found a significant association. This suggests that measurement error may be playing a role in these variable outcomes, highlighting the need for objective quantitative diagnosis. Longer follow-up is also vital to assess if school-age outcome can be accurately predicted [49]. Due to the limited cohort size, we modeled the data using univariate regression only. For future larger studies, many other cofactors and clinical predictors can be incorporated to build a more complete and accurate multivariable model. Additional larger studies with school-age outcomes are needed to determine if WMSA in conjunction with other predictive factors could facilitate early infancy identification of individual infants at high risk for cognitive/language deficits and permit more intensive early intervention therapies. 

In summary, we constructed an age-specific very preterm infant probabilistic atlas. Guided with this atlas, we then proposed a fully automated method for WMSA detection and quantification using clinically available T2-weighted images. Computer simulations and validation using in vivo very preterm data showed very high detection accuracy. Correlational analyses demonstrated that WMSA volume at TEA predicted short-term language and cognitive developmental outcomes. Our work will facilitate population-based studies to more accurately characterize WMSA’s long-term sequelae.

Tolvaptan is vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist that inhibits water reabsorption. It is used in combination with standard diuretics to treat ascites unresponsive to standard diuretic therapy or hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of tolvaptan in clinical practice and aimed to determine the factors related to its effectiveness.

Methods
Tolvaptan was administered to 88 consecutive cirrhotic patients with ascites unresponsive to standard diuretic therapy. An effective treatment response was a ≥2% reduction in body weight on day 7. The association of patient pretreatment characteristics with therapeutic effects was analyzed.

Results
Mean weight reduction on day 7 of tolvaptan therapy was −2.9% ± 3.2%, and treatment was effective in 52% of patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that spot urine Na/K ratio ≥2.5 at baseline was the only factor independently related to therapeutic effect, with an odds ratio of 7.85 (95% confidence interval 2.64–23.40, p = 0.0002). Weight reduction percentage on day 7 was −4.0% ± 2.8% in patients with spot urine Na/K ≥2.5, which was significantly greater than the 0.7% ± 2.7% loss in those with urine Na/K < 2.5 (p < 0.05). A spot urine Na/K ratio ≥2.5 had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 60% for predicting effective treatment. No adverse events of treatment led to treatment discontinuation.

Conclusions
Baseline spot urine Na/K was predictive of an effective response to tolvaptan therapy. It is simple to perform and readily available and might serve as an indicator of optimal timing of tolvaptan administration in patients with inadequate response to conventional Na diuretic therapy.

==== Body
Introduction
Hepatic edema and ascites are common complications of decompensated cirrhosis leading to reduced patient quality of life [1]. Hepatic ascites is refractory in about 10% of patients, and does not respond to salt restriction and standard diuretic drugs [2–5]. Tolvaptan (Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) is a nonpeptide antagonist of vasopressin type 2 receptor, a novel class of diuretic drugs. It binds to the vasopressin V2 receptors of principle cells in the renal collecting ducts. It inhibits the expression of aquaporin-2 (AQP2), a vasopressin-regulated water channel, in the apical membrane of renal collecting duct cells. A reduction of AQP2 water channels in the collecting ducts prevents water reabsorption, and promotes urine excretion [6].

Tolvaptan is used to treat patients with heart failure or hyponatremia [7–9], but following successful Phase 3 trials, tolvaptan was approved in September 2013 in Japan for treatment of refractory ascites [10], and is widely used to treat ascites refractory to other diuretics. However, only a few reports of clinical experience have been published [6, 11, 12, 13]. Consequently, patient factors that influence tolvaptan effectiveness are unclear, and the optimal time to begin tolvaptan administration have not been identified.

The guideline of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease reports a daily urine Na excretion ≥78 mmol/day as an indicator of good ascites control with Na diuretics [3]. It is not easy to measure daily urine Na excretion in routine outpatient care. However, the spot urine Na/K ratio correlates well with daily urinary Na excretion, and can predict responsiveness to diuretics [14–16]. Although spot urine Na/K ratio may be effective as a surrogate marker of daily urine Na excretion, the relationship of spot urine Na/K ratio and tolvaptan therapeutic response is unclear. In this study, we focused on spot urine Na/K and its relationship with tolvaptan effectiveness.

Patients and methods
Patients
This prospective observational study included 88 consecutive cirrhotic patients with ascites not controlled by moderate dose of diuretics. All patients received tolvaptan treatment at Musashino Red Cross Hospital between August 2013 and December 2015. Patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis were eligible if they had ascites unresponsive to standard diuretic therapy consisting of spironolactone, furosemide, or both, in addition to sodium (<5g/day) and water (<1000 mL/day) restriction. The dose of diuretics eligible for inclusion in this was spironolactone≧25mg and/or furosemide ≧20mg. Basically, diuretic therapy was started with spironolactone at dose 25mg or 50mg, then furosemide at dose 20mg or 40mg was added. Addition of tolvaptan was considered if ascites was not controlled by these diuretics. Our policy was to avoid high dose of diuretics because it may cause renal insufficiency. Therefore, tolvaptan therapy was preferentially introduced before the appearance of renal dysfunction. The lack of response to diuretics was defined as the presence of ascites after treatment by furosemide and/or spironolactone for at least 1 months. Patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy, active gastrointestinal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, stage 4 chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2), or heart failure were excluded.

Spironolactone and furosemide dosage was fixed 7 days before, and continued during, tolvaptan administration. Diuretics was not discontinued before or during the study period. Tolvaptan 3.75 mg or 7.5 mg was administered once daily. In the event that the treatment was initiated at a dose of 3.75 mg/day but the response was judged not effective, the dosage was increased to 7.5 mg after few days. In the initial period of this study, we mainly used 3.75mg dose as introduction because we were uncertain of possible adverse events. After confirming the safety of tolvaptan at 7.5mg in several patients, we used 7.5mg dose for most patients. For the baseline data, blood and spot urine test was obtained in the early morning of the day that treatment began, before the administration of diuretics. To avoid hypovolemia and hypernatremia, water intake was not restricted during treatment with tolvaptan in accordance with the instruction of the package insert of tolvaptan. The use of albumin infusion was not restricted during the study period. However, to exclude the short-term effect of albumin infusion on diuretic response, patients who received albumin infusion within 1 week prior to the start of tolvaptan was not included. Patients who received albumin infusion within 7 days after the start of tolvaptan due to insufficient diuretic response to tolvaptan were regarded as ineffective. Patients who had past history of large volume paracentesis were included in the present study. In these patients, tolvaptan was started after we confirmed that patients’ weight became stable after paracentesis.

To date, there is no established criteria to define response to tolvaptan. Therefore, response to tolvaptan was tentatively defined as weight reduction of 2% at day 7 of treatment. Patients with a weight reduction ≥ 2% compared with their baseline weight were recorded as effective cases. Patients who could not continue treatment for 7 days, and patients underwent large volume paracentesis within 7 days after the start of treatment were recorded as ineffective cases. After the patients were stratified into two groups by their response to treatment, the association of demographic and clinical characteristics with the therapeutic effect was analyzed.

Ethical considerations
This study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethics committees of the Musashino Red Cross Hospital. Written informed consent to receive tolvaptan treatment and to be included in this study was obtained from each study participant.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama Japan), which is a graphical user interface for R (the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). More precisely, a modified version of the R-commander package with additional statistical functions frequently used in biostatistics [17]. Differences in continuous variables were compared with the paired t-test. Differences categorical data values were compared using Fischer’s exact test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on factors that had a significant relationship with treatment effect in univariate analysis. The cut-off value for continuous variables was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, or by using the reference normal value. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics of patients
The mean patient age was 69.3 years, and most frequent (53%) underlying liver disease was hepatitis C virus infection. Liver function was Child-Pugh class C in 34 patients (39%); 40 patients (45.5%) had concurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (Table 1). Among 40 patients with HCC, only 1 patient received active treatment for HCC, intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy, during the study period of 7 days. There was no obvious change in the volume of HCC that could cause any improvement of portal hypertension or liver function during the study period. In other patients, active treatment for HCC was not possible because their liver function was too impaired. The median furosemide dose was 20 mg daily; the median spironolactone dose was 50 mg daily.

Treatment efficacy: Weight reduction
The mean weight reduction on day 7 of tolvaptan therapy was 2.9% ± 3.2%. Forty-six patients (52%) achieved a ≥2% reduction on day 7. Symptoms such as abdominal distension or dyspnea was improved in 78% of patients with ≥2% reduction in their weight. Treatment was discontinued before day 7 in two patients who did not respond, but there were no discontinuations caused by adverse events. Seven patients had paracentesis before day 7 and were evaluated with the patients in the ineffective treatment group.

Treatment efficacy: Correction of hyponatremia
Twenty-two patients had hyponatremia (serum Na < 135 mEq/L) before tolvaptan therapy. There was a trend in increase of serum Na from 130.3 ± 4.4 mEq/L at baseline to 132.2 ± 4.4 mEq/L on day 7 after tolvaptan (p = 0.08). Baseline hyponatremia was corrected (serum Na > 135 mEq/L) in five of 22 patients (23%), but serum Na did not change in patients with normal serum Na at baseline (138.7 ± 2.4 mEq/L at baseline to 138.9 ± 3.3, p = 0.81 on day 7).

Factors associated with therapeutic effect
Pretreatment characteristics in the effective treatment and ineffective treatment groups were compared (Table 2). There were no significant differences in age, gender, Child-Pugh class, presence or absence of liver cancer, or furosemide/spironolactone dose. When we compare the rate of response between patients with or without prior paracentesis, the rate of response was 33.3% versus 57.1% which was not statistically different (p = 0.11). The effective treatment group had a mean lower C-reactive protein (CRP) level (0.76 ± 0.96 vs. 1.51 ± 1.63 mg/dL, p = 0.01), lower platelet count (8.7 ± 5.4 vs. 11.5 ± 6.3 103/C, p = 0.03), higher mean spot urine Na level (76.5 ± 27.5 vs. 57.3 ± 33.4 mEq/L, p = 0.004), and higher mean spot urine Na/K ratio (4.5 ± 2.2 vs. 2.6 ± 2.0, p < 0.001) than the ineffective treatment group (Table 2). ROC analysis revealed that a spot urine Na/K ratio ≥2.5 was the best cutoff value to determine effectiveness (Fig 1). The prediction accuracy of spot urine Na/K ratio ≥2.5 had sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 60%, positive predictive value of 70%, and negative predictive value of 78%. Multivariate analysis revealed that spot urine Na/K ratio ≥2.5 was the only factor independently related to effectiveness, with an odds ratio of 7.85, 95% CI of 2.64–23.40, and p < 0.05 (Table 3). The percentage weight reduction on day 7 was significantly higher in patients with a spot urine Na/K ratio ≥ 2.5 than in those with a ration <2.5 (4.0% ± 2.8% vs −0.7% ± 2.7%, p < 0.05, Fig 2).

Factors associated with urine Na/K ratio
The relationship between spot urine Na/K ratio and total urine Na excretion per day was analyzed in 23 patients with 24-hour urine collection prior to starting tolvaptan. ROC analysis revealed that the spot urine Na/K ratio was closely associated with urine Na excretion ≥78 mmol/day with an area under curve of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.85–1.0, Fig 3). For predicting a urine Na excretion ≥78 mmol/day, spot urine Na/K ratio ≥ 2.5 had sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 100%.

Safety
Temporary hypernatremia (serum Na > 145 mEq/L) was observed in four patients on day 2 after tolvaptan introduction, in three patients on day 3, and in one patient on day 7; all patients recovered without discontinuing tolvaptan therapy. Decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >25% was observed in six patients in the effective treatment group, and three in the ineffective treatment group. Two patients in the effective treatment group spontaneously improved during the treatment period; three improved after reducing the tolvaptan and furosemide dosages. One patient who did not recover had advanced liver failure caused by exacerbation of the underlying disease. Two of the three patients in the ineffective treatment group had advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and one had advanced liver cirrhosis with a Child-Pugh score of 12. No patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events, including a patient with liver dysfunction.

Discussion
In this study, tolvaptan was effective in 52% of patients with ascites not controlled by moderate dose of diuretics such as spironolactone and/or furosemide. A spot urine Na/K ration ≥2.5 prior to administration was predictive of effective tolvaptan treatment. Using this criterion, we were able to include 85% of patients in an effective treatment group. Measurement of spot urine Na/K ratio is easy to do and is readily available, changes during the natural course of liver cirrhosis could be monitored without cost, and thus might be utilized in clinical practice for patient selection or optimize the timing of tolvaptan treatment.

Conventional diuretics used to treat ascites include spironolactone and furosemide which are Na diuretics. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, and is effective in 50% to 90% of cases [18]. Patients with inadequate responses to spironolactone are given escalating doses of furosemide in combination. However, approximately 10% of hepatic ascites are refractory to these standard diuretic drugs [2–5]; moreover high doses of furosemide has been reported to cause renal dysfunction [19, 20] leading to decreased survival [21].

Tolvaptan, an antagonist of vasopressin type 2 receptor, inhibits water reabsorption and promotes the excretion of free water without increasing Na excretion. Its diuretic mechanism is totally different from conventional diuretics, which promote Na excretion into the urine. Clinical trials in Japan confirmed the efficacy of tolvaptan for refractory ascites regardless of serum albumin level [10], and the safely of a 14-day dosage regimen [22]. Tolvaptan was approved for use in combination with Na diuretics for refractory ascites in 2013. This alternative option for refractory ascites is expected to improve the efficacy and safety of treatment. In the latest version of the Japanese guideline, tolvaptan is recommended to be used in patients who are refractory to diuretics, before considering intra venous administration of diuretics, intra venous administration of albumin, large volume paracentesis, TIPS or peritoneal-venous shunting. In fact, after the approval of tolvaptan, early administration of tolvaptan before increasing furosemide or spironolactone to maximal dose is now common in Japan. Although this agent is widely used in clinical practice, few published reports have described its effectiveness in clinical practice.

Akiyama et al. defined a good patient response as a loss of ≥3 kg body weight loss on day 4 of tolvaptan therapy, and a 46.7% good response rate [12]. Kogiso et al. reported that long-term tolvaptan therapy of 6 months resulted in improvement of the extracellular fluid/total body water ratio in 78.6% of patients [13]. Furthermore, Oki et al. reported that tolvaptan therapy was effective in 63.3% of patients based on improvement in subjective symptoms and a weight loss of ≥2 kg [11]. In this study, 52% of patients experienced a weight loss of ≥2% with 1 week of tolvaptan therapy even though the existing diuretic regimen was not effective. Collectively, tolvaptan was effective in more than half of the patients with refractory ascites, and no patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Therefore, we believe that, for refractory hepatic ascites, tolvaptan is an effective treatment option. To date, there is no established criteria to define response to tolvaptan. Therefore, response to tolvaptan was tentatively defined as weight reduction of 2% at day 7 of treatment in the present study. By this tentative definition, symptoms such as abdominal distension or dyspnea was improved in 78% of patients with ≥2% reduction in their weight. Therefore, we believe that this tentative definition of response was clinically relevant.

It would be very helpful to be able to identify those patients who are not likely to respond to tolvaptan in advance of treatment. Currently factors that predict therapeutic efficacy are unclear. Oki et al. reported a hazard ratio of 20.7 for achieving a 25% reduction in urine osmolality when tolvaptan therapy was effective [11]. This finding demonstrates that when tolvaptan is effective to inhibit water reabsorption, it promotes free-water excretion, leading to urine dilution and decrease in osmolality. Nakanishi et al. focused on urine AQP2, demonstrated that urinary AQP2/creatinine decreased after tolvaptan administration, and that the decrease was strongly correlated with decreased urine osmolality [6]. This showed that tolvaptan inhibition of vasopressin V2 receptors can be assessed by urine AQP2. However changes in both urinary osmolality and urine AQP2 occur after tolvaptan administration, thus there are no established pretreatment predictive factors.

In this study, we found that baseline spot urine Na/K ratio was independently associated with tolvaptan effectiveness. As measurement of spot urine Na/K ratio is simple, easily done, and readily available, it can be used in clinical practice to identify patients likely to respond to tolvaptan therapy. As the spot urine Na/K ratio changes during the natural course of liver cirrhosis, it might be used to determine the best time to initiate tolvaptan administration.

Consistent with previous reports, the spot urine Na/K ratio was significantly correlated with daily urinary Na excretion [3, 14, 15, 16]. The association of the spot urine Na/K ratio with tolvaptan efficacy indicates that maintenance of Na excretion was required for tolvaptan effectiveness. This seems reasonable because tolvaptan’s mechanism of action includes inhibition of water reabsorption and promotion of free water excretion without increasing Na excretion. To achieve maximal effect, both Na excretion and free water excretion are necessary.

The present study have some limitations. Patients with TIPS were not included in the present study because TIPS insertion is not performed in our institute. The dose of diuretics was relatively low to moderate, because our policy was to avoid high dose of diuretics to avoid renal insufficiency. Especially, the dosage of spironolactone was particularly low compared to the recommendation by international societies. Although the response to tolvaptan was similar between patients with spironolactone <50mg vs. ≥50mg, it remains unclear whether the similar response to tolvaptan could be achieved by using higher dosage of spironolactone or whether the result of the present study will be applicable in patients receiving a higher dose of diuretics. Therefore, the predictive value of spot urine Na/K ratio for patients under higher dose of diuretics, or those treated by TIPS should be evaluated in the future study.

We conclude that the pretreatment spot urine Na/K ratio can indicate the likelihood of effective tolvaptan treatment, and for ascites patients with insufficient response to conventional Na diuretic treatment, tolvaptan should be introduced when the urine Na/K is ≥2.5 to maximize the efficacy. This simple to perform, readily available criterion could serve to indicate the optimal timing of tolvaptan administration.

However, ethnic differences in mutations, the association between mutation genotype/clinical phenotype, and the clinical applicable value of mutation detection are poorly understood. We made systematically analysis of Chinese ADPKD patients based on a next-generation sequencing platform. Among 148 ADPKD patients enrolled, 108 mutations were detected in 127 patients (85.8%). Compared with mutations in Caucasian published previously, the PKD2 mutation detection rate was lower, and patients carrying the PKD2 mutation invariably carried the PKD1 mutation. The definite pathogenic mutation detection rate was lower, whereas the multiple mutations detection rate was higher in Chinese patients. Then, we correlated PKD1/PKD2 mutation data and clinical data: patients with mutation exhibited a more severe phenotype; patients with >1 mutations exhibited a more severe phenotype; patients with pathogenic mutations exhibited a more severe phenotype. Thus, the PKD1/PKD2 mutation status differed by ethnicity, and the PKD1/PKD2 genotype may affect the clinical phenotype of ADPKD. Furthermore, it makes sense to detect PKD1/PKD2 mutation status for early diagnosis and prognosis, perhaps as early as the embryo/zygote stage, to facilitate early clinical intervention and family planning.
==== Body
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disorder with a 50% risk of inheritance1. Approximately 50% of ADPKD patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) before age 6023, making ADPKD the fourth leading cause of ESRD that heavily burdens social and families4. Therefore, delaying the progression and reducing the incidence of ADPKD are important from both a research and clinical perspective.

ADPKD is genetically heterogeneous, and two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, have been identified to participate in this disease5. Previous studies of PKD1/PKD2 mutations mainly focused on Caucasians, and this mutation has not been thoroughly analysed in large samples of the Asian population. Furthermore, differences between Caucasian and Asian populations are poorly understood.

ADPKD is a chronic progressive disease that is mainly diagnosed by renal imaging techniques coupled with an age-specific renal phenotype67, and effective clinical treatments for this disease are currently lacking. Therefore, the early diagnosis of ADPKD using genetic testing prior to clinical imaging diagnosis, the appropriate monitoring of clinical indexes and timely symptomatic treatment may delay the progression of ADPKD. Notably, reducing the incidence of new cases by detecting disease-causing gene mutations in embryos or zygotes of patients with ADPKD and providing reasonable fertility recommendations may reduce the incidence of this disease. Although correlations between the phenotype and genotype in ADPKD patients have been reported in previous studies, the correlation between the genotype (such as with/without mutation, mutation number, mutation position, and mutation type) and clinical phenotype has not yet been described in detail. Therefore, detecting mutations in ADPKD patients may not only provide evidence for ADPKD diagnosis but also provide reference information to predict ADPKD progression and permit family planning. To this end, sequencing technology has rapidly developed in recent years. Specifically, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely used to study gene testing for genetic diseases due to its advantages of high coverage and deep sequencing as well as its ability to simultaneously analyse several samples8. Therefore, NGS may be used to detect ADPKD mutations to broaden the use of genetic diagnosis in the setting of ADPKD.

This study aimed to systematically analyse Chinese ADPKD patients based on a NGS platform. Specifically, ① we detected mutations in the target region (PKD1 and PKD2) in Chinese patients and compared the resultant data with mutations previously detected in Caucasian patients; ② we systematically associated mutations in PKD1/PKD2 and clinical data.

Results
Patient characteristics
One hundred and forty-eight patients with ADPKD were enrolled in this study. The male to female ratio was 70:78, and the mean age of patients was 43.47 ± 12.73 years. The mean age at diagnosis was 34.08 ± 10.07 years (range, 12–66 years). Eighty-two patients (55.4%) had clear family history.

Description of mutations in targeted region
The quality of NGS data were shown in Supplementary Table 1. A total of 108 mutations were identified (101 and 7 mutations found in PKD1 and PKD2, respectively) (Supplementary Table 2). The novel mutation detection rate was 70.4% (76/108). Thirty-five novel mutations without clear family history were identified among the total 148 ADPKD patients. The pathogenic predictions were shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3.

In our enrolled cohort, 21 patients did not harbour mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene (14.2%, 21/148). One hundred-eighteen (79.7%, 118/148) harboured PKD1 mutation, 1 (0.7%, 1/148) harboured PKD2 mutation, and 8 (5.4%, 8/148) harboured mutations in both PKD1 and PKD2; the mutation detection rate was 85.8% (127/148). Seventy one (48.0%, 71/148) patients had at least two mutations in the targeted region. The definite pathogenic mutation detection rate was 27.7% (41/148), the probable pathogenic mutation detection rate was 23.6% (35/148).

Comparison of mutation features of PKD1/PKD2 between Caucasian and Chinese patients
As shown in Table 1, a literature review yielded 21 studies (13 on Caucasian, 8 on Asian) in which PKD1/PKD2 was entirely screened for mutation detection. This study examined the largest sample of Chinese ADPKD patients to date. First, we compared the mutation rates between Caucasian and Chinese patients: ① the mutation detection rate in reached ~80% in most studies of Caucasian patients (ranging from 62.8% to 89.9%), and the mutation detection rate was 85.8% in this study; ② the majority of studies of Caucasian populations reported a PKD2 mutation detection rate ranging from 10.3–17.4%, and the proportion of PKD1 and PKD2 mutations were approximately 85% and 15%, respectively, in Caucasians, whereas the proportion of PKD2 mutations was less than 6.1% (including patients who also harboured a PKD1 mutation) in this study; ③ADPKD patients were divided into PKD1 patients or PKD2 patients based on the independent presence of PKD1/PKD2 in Caucasian populations, but eight of the 9 patients harbouring a PKD2 mutation also harboured a PKD1 mutation in this study; in other words, only one patient harboured only a PKD2 mutation in this study. In addition, Chinese ADPKD patients in this study were a similar age or even older than Caucasian patients; ④ most Caucasian patients harboured only single unique mutations, whereas almost half of all ADPKD patients (48.0%) in this study harboured more than one mutation; ⑤ the definite pathogenic mutation detection rate was lower in Chinese individuals (27.7%) than in Caucasian individuals (ranging from 35.1% to 66.6%).

Of the 8 studies of Asian populations, only one enrolled more than 100 patients (Japanese); therefore, we also compared mutations between Chinese and Japanese individuals. We found that the proportion of PKD2 mutations in Japanese patients (28.1%) was higher than that in Chinese individuals and in Caucasian individuals, and the definite pathogenic mutation detection rate in Japanese individuals (52.2%) was higher than that in Chinese individuals.

Relationship between genotype and phenotype
Influence of with/without mutation detected targeted region on phenotype
As shown in Table 2, the serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, and CysC levels were significantly higher in patients with mutations (P = 0.003, 0.013, and 0.009, respectively) than in mutation-free patients. The level of eGFR was lower (P = 0.005) and the kidney volume was larger (P = 0.011) in patients with mutations than in mutation-free patients.

Influence of PKD2 mutation on phenotype
As shown in Supplementary Table 4, we made comperasion between patients harboring indeterminate PKD1 mutation & PKD2 mutation and patients harboring indeterminate PKD1 mutation, then we only found the differences on in incidence of polycystic liver and serum total protein and there was no differences on kidney phenotype.

Influence of mutation number on phenotype
Because only 9 patients of the enrolled patients harboured a PKD2 mutation, they were removed from the subsequent analysis of the association between the PKD1 mutation rate and clinical phenotype. We compared patients with one mutation to those with more than one mutation and found that the kidney volume was significantly larger (P = 0.035) and eGFR expression was significantly lower (P = 0.033) in patients with more than one mutation than in patients with one mutation (Table 3).

Influence of mutation position on phenotype
We evaluated the influence of mutation location along the PKD1 gene; specifically, patients with one mutation in the PKD1 gene were separated into three groups according to the mutation position (group 1, 5′ end to position 2147228; group 2, position 2150076–2156600; group 3, position 2158432 to 3′), and we did not find significant differences in the clinical data (Supplementary Table 5).

Influence of mutation pathogenic type on phenotype
To eliminate the effect of multiple mutations on phenotype, we analysed patients with a single PKD1 mutation (n = 55). Compared with patients with a definite pathogenic mutation and those with a probable pathogenic mutation, patients with an indeterminate mutation exhibited a better phenotype (Supplementary Table 6). Because patients with definite and probable pathogenic mutations did not significantly differ, we combined these patients into one group (pathogenic mutation group). Compared with patients with an indeterminate mutation and patients without mutation, patients with a pathogenic mutation exhibited a poorer phenotype (Supplementary Table 7). Although the clinical data did not significantly differ between patients with an indeterminate mutation and those without mutations, patients with indeterminate mutations tended to have higher serum creatinine, higher serum urea nitrogen, higher CysC, and lower eGFR levels.

We then divided patients who harboured PKD1 mutation or were free of mutations into three groups, i.e., patients with pathogenic mutation, patients with indeterminate mutation, and patients without mutations, and compared these groups. As shown in Table 4, patients with pathogenic mutations had higher serum creatinine levels (P < 0.001), serum urea nitrogen levels (P = 0.008, 0.002), CysC levels (P = 0.001, 0.002) and kidney volumes (P = 0.021, 0.004) and lower eGFR levels (P < 0.001) than patients harbouring indeterminate mutations and mutation-free patients. The clinical data of patients with indeterminate mutations and those without mutations did not significantly differ.

Discussion
This study features 3 innovative aspects: ① we screened PKD1/PKD2 mutations in the largest sample of Chinese ADPKD patients using an advanced sequencing technique (targeted next-generation sequencing); ② this study was the first to compare mutation features between Chinese (Asian) patients and Caucasian (Western) patients with ADPKD; ③ we correlated the detailed genotype (with/without mutation, mutation number, mutation location, mutation pathogenic type etc.) and clinical phenotype (detailed clinical data).

In the present study, one hundred eight mutations were detected using NGS, all of which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, which demonstrates that the targeted NGS platform was reliable to detect PKD1 and PKD2 mutation. Thus, the targeted NGS platform reduced the time and cost necessary for the genetic diagnosis of ADPKD and may serve as an efficient approach to detect mutations in PKD1/PKD2.

Based on the targeted NGS platform, we the analysed genotype and phenotypes of ADPKD patients in China. First, the comparison of Chinese and Caucasian patients yielded the following five findings: ① in this study, the overall detection rate was 85.8% and agreed with the detection levels of 89.1% and 89.9% in Caucasians reported by Rossetti et al.9 and Audrezet et al.10 in other words, the detection rate remained consistent between Chinese and Caucasian individuals; ② the majority of studies of Caucasian patients reported a PKD2 mutation detection rate ranging from 10.3%-17.4%, whereas only one patient harboured a single PKD2 mutation in this study, suggesting that the PKD2 detection rate might be higher in Caucasians than in Chinese individuals; ③ the majority of Caucasian patients harboured a unique mutation in PKD1 or PKD2, whereas 8 of the 9 patients with a PKD2 mutation in this study also had PKD1 mutation; therefore, we speculated that PKD2 mutations may accompany PKD1 mutations more commonly in Chinese patients. Then we compared the age between Caucasian and Chinese patients, and found that compared with Carcasian patients, Chinese ADPKD patients in this study were a similar age or even older, which might be a more evidence for that the incidence of PKD2 mutation in Chinese is lower. ④ among the 148 patients in this study, seventy one patients (48.0%) harboured more than one mutations. However, no single mutation accounted for >2% of all unrelated ADPKD patients in previous studies (Caucasian population)10. Thus, patients with more than one mutation were more common in Chinese; ⑤ we found that the definite pathogenic mutation detection rate in this study was lower than those reported in Caucasian patients. Thus, the PKD1/PKD2 mutation rate may differ by ethnic group, which may explain the epidemiology of ADPKD. In addition, we found differences in the PKD2 mutation proportion and definite pathogenic mutation detection rate between Chinese and Japanese individuals, which may be due to differences among Asian populations or differences in the sequencing methods between the two studies. Thus, further studies utilizing different arrays are warranted.

Then, we correlated the mutation characteristic (genotype) in PKD1/PKD2 and clinical phenotype in detail. This analysis yielded the following findings ① mutation-free patients exhibited a milder phenotype than patients harbouring a mutation; ② the ADPKD patients harboring both PKD1 and PKD2 mutation did not have a more severe clinical phenotype than the patients only harboring PKD1 mutation; ③ patients with more than one mutation exhibited a poorer phenotype than patients harbouring a single mutation; ④ mutation location may not affect the clinical phenotype; ⑤ patients harbouring a pathogenic mutation (definite pathogenic mutation or probable pathogenic mutation) exhibited poorer renal function than patients with an indeterminate mutation and mutation-free patients. These findings suggested that the presence, frequency, and pathogenic type of PKD1 might significantly affect the clinical phenotype. Thus, multiple mutations and at least one pathogenic mutation would predict a severe clinical manifestation and poor prognosis. Consequently, mutation sequencing information may not only diagnose but also predict the prognosis of ADPKD, which facilitates personalized patient management and provides family planning advice. Therefore, we should closely monitor the clinical indexes and administer timely treatment to high-risk patients (with multiple mutation/pathogenic mutation), whereas only regular follow-up is necessary for low-risk patients (with indeterminate mutations or no mutation). These interventions may help delay the progression of ADPKD. In addition, a genetic diagnosis based on mutation detection in embryos or even zygotes and defining mutation number and pathogenic type for ADPKD patients undergoing family planning may provide reasonable fertility recommendations to help decrease the incidence of ADPKD. Given the reduced cost of gene sequencing, such as targeted NGS, and the increasing number ADPKD patients whose phenotype is known, bringing PKD mutation types to clinical practice will likely reduce the economic cost of disease and reduce monitoring in patients destined to be symptom free while proactively increasing preventive monitoring for patients at high risk for progressive renal disease. In addition, defining the genetic mutation in ADPKD will better define the appropriate patient population for randomized clinical trials and develop new rationales for treatment using the molecular information obtained from locus and mutation detection810111213141516171819202122232425262728.

In conclusion, NGS may be an optimal sequencing technology to detect causative mutations in ADPKD patients because it increases the mutation detection rate while reducing test costs and turnaround time. As shown in Fig. 1, the clinical phenotype is related to the genotype (with/without mutation, mutation number, and mutation type) in the targeted region. Therefore, mutation sequencing of the targeted gene (PKD1/PKD2) should not be limited to the diagnosis of ADPKD but is of great significance as predictor of prognosis for ADPKD patients. Thus, this approach may help physicians and patients to take optimal measures to delay the progression and decrease the incidence of ADPKD, which is highly important for the long-term prevention of ADPKD (Fig. 1).

A comprehensive literature search for studies published until August 2015 was undertaken in PUBMED using the following relevant index words: “autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease/polycystic kidney disease/ADPKD” and “mutation/sequencing/PKD1/PKD2”. We also checked the references of the included trials to identify other studies. The studies in which PKD1 was not entirely screened were excluded.

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software, version 19 (SPSS, Inc., Armonk, NY). Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as the mean ± SD, and non-normally distributed variables are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR). The normality of continuous variables was visually assessed using Q-Q plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Groups were compared using the unpaired t-test, chi-squared test, or Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis test. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate significant differences133031.

Figure 1 Flow diagram of genetic diagnosis (mutation detection and pathogenic prediction in PKD1/PKD2) based on the next-generation sequencing platform, and the clinical significance of genetic diagnosis for delaying progression and reducing the incidence of ADPKD: ① one hundred and forty eight patients diagnosed with ADPKD were enrolled, and their peripheral blood was subjected to next-generation sequencing.
After a comparison with databases, normal variations and artefact variants were filtered out, resulting to 108 mutations detected in 127 patients (85.8%). Of these 148 patients, one hundred and eighteen (79.7%, 118/148) harboured a mutation in PKD1, 1 (0.7%, 1/148) harboured a mutation in PKD2, 8 (5.4%, 8/148) harboured mutations in both PKD1 and PKD2, and 21 lacked PKD1/PKD2 mutations (14.2%, 21/148). The pathogenicity of mutations was predicted, and they were categorized into three types (definite pathogenic mutation, probable pathogenic mutation, and indeterminate mutation). Thus, the patients were divided into three groups: patients with pathogenic mutation, patients with indeterminate mutation, and mutation-free patients. The association of genotype/phenotype showed that patients with a pathogenic mutation had higher serum creatinine levels, higher serum urea nitrogen levels, higher cystatin c levels, larger kidney volumes, and lower eGFR levels than patients with indeterminate mutations or mutation-free patients. Based on these data, ADPKD patients were categorized into two groups: the high-risk group (with pathogenic mutations) and the low-risk group (with indeterminate mutation or no mutation). ② Including genetic diagnosis in clinical practice will likely reduce the economic cost of the disease and reduce monitoring patients destined to be symptom-free while proactively increasing preventive monitoring for patients at high risk for progressive renal disease to help delay the progression of ADPKD. In addition, genetic diagnoses of embryos or even zygotes for ADPKD patients who have a family plan may provide reasonable fertility recommendations to help decrease the incidence of ADPKD.

To the Editor: Picobirnaviruses (family Picobirnaviridae) are nonenveloped, double-stranded RNA viruses of vertebrates with a bisegmented genome. Segment 1 (2.2–2.7 kb) encodes the capsid protein, and segment 2 (1.2–1.9 kb) encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. On the basis of sequence diversity in segment 2, picobirnaviruses are classified into 2 genogroups (1–4). Picobirnaviruses have been detected in fecal samples from humans with and without gastroenteritis; in patients co-infected with known enteric pathogens, including rotaviruses, caliciviruses, and astroviruses (1,4); and in a wide range of animals, such as pigs, calves, dogs, monkeys, and snakes. The pathogenicity of picobirnaviruses largely remains to be determined, but studies in immunocompromised persons suggest that picobirnaviruses may be opportunistic enteric pathogens (5,6).

Recently, we identified picobirnaviruses in the respiratory tract of pigs in Asia, and this identification expanded the knowledge on the tropism and host range of picobirnaviruses (7). No respiratory or other clinical signs were observed in these pigs at the time of sampling, making it unclear whether picobirnaviruses are indeed respiratory pathogens (7). To determine whether picobirnaviruses could also be present in the human respiratory tract, we performed a diagnostic genogroup I picobirnavirus PCR, with degenerated primers, that targeted the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding region (1,4,8) on 309 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens collected from 309 patients with respiratory disease of unknown origin in the Netherlands during 2003–2006. (All study procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.)

Samples from 3 patients were confirmed by sequencing to be positive for genogroup I picobirnaviruses. To determine genetic relationships between human genogroup I picobirnaviruses from the respiratory tract and genogroup I picobirnaviruses detected in wastewater and in human and porcine fecal samples, we constructed a phylogenetic tree on the basis of a ≈165-nt fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene as described (8) (Figure). Before tree construction, 75 groups were created from the ≈300 available picobirnavirus sequences by using FastGroup II (10). Because the average pair-wise Jukes-Cantor distance was 0.46, a neighbor-joining tree was created by using the Jukes-Cantor model, with a bootstrap replication of 1,000 (Figure). One of the 3 genogroup I picobirnavirus sequences found in this study, PBVI/Homo sapiens/VS2000057/2003, showed <95% sequence identity with previously described picobirnavirus sequences and is shown as a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. The genogroup I picobirnavirus nucleotide sequences from the respiratory tracts of persons in the Netherlands showed 58% to 97% similarity with each other. They belonged to different phylogenetic clades and did not group with other picobirnaviruses according to year of isolation or host species.

Figure Neighbor-joining (Jukes-Cantor model) phylogenetic tree of an ≈165-bp fragment of the genogroup I picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene from known human, porcine, and wastewater genogroup I picobirnaviruses and newly characterized genogroup I picobirnaviruses (sequences are available on request) from the human respiratory tract. Each branch represents a sequence or group of sequences (95% identical with gaps) indicated by the presence of a colored block. Every branch corresponds to the adjacent table, which explains the source, year of isolation, and location of the virus variants. Reference sequences from previously published studies are identified by their GenBank accession numbers. The designations for picobirnaviruses from various species are designated as follows: P, porcine; WW, wastewater; D, dog; S, snake; R, rat; H, human; The different countries of isolation are designated as follows: A, Argentina; Br, Brazil; Ch, China; H, Hungary; I, India; NL, the Netherlands; USA, United States of America; T, Thailand; V, Venezuela. The sequences from the newly identified human respiratory picobirnaviruses in this study comply with recent nomenclature proposals (9) and are indicated in red.

In conclusion, the identification of new picobirnaviruses in respiratory tract samples from pigs (7) prompted us to look for the presence of picobirnaviruses in the respiratory tracts of humans. Genogroup I picobirnaviruses could be identified in some of the bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from patients with unexplained respiratory disease in the Netherlands. This observation expands our knowledge of picobirnaviruses in humans and provides a clear example of how epidemiologic baseline information on virus host range and tropism in animals may provide indications for the presence of similar viruses in the same organ system of humans. To clarify the epidemiology and pathogenicity of picobirnaviruses in humans, additional surveillance should be carried out in persons with and without respiratory and enteric disease.

Our earlier studies defined a mechanistic model for male hormone dependent regulation of AR protein levels in prostate cancer (CaP) cells through a negative feed-back loop between AR and PMEPA1, an androgen induced NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase binding protein.

In cell culture models knockdown of PMEPA1 resulted in resistance to AR inhibitors enzalutamide and bicalutamide. While, AR protein down regulation by NEDD4 was PMEPA1 dependent, we also noted a PMEPA1 independent downregulation of PTEN by NEDD4. In a subset of human CaP, decreased PMEPA1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with increased levels of AR transcription target PSA, as a surrogate for elevated AR. This study highlights that silencing of PMEPA1 accelerates the growth of CaP cells through AR, NEDD4 and PTEN. Thus, the therapeutic restoration of PMEPA1 represents a promising complementary strategy correcting for AR and PTEN defects in CaP. Statement of significance: Here we define that silencing of PMEPA1 facilitates the growth of CaP cells and modulates AR through NEDD4 and PTEN. The restoration of PMEPA1 represents a promising complementary therapeutic strategy correcting for AR and PTEN defects.

INTRODUCTION
AR is a nuclear transcription factor that executes key function in normal and malignant growth of the prostate gland [1–5]. The tight control of AR signaling is critical in maintaining the homeostasis of the prostate gland. Malignancy of prostate still remains the most common cancer detected in American men and second leading cause of cancer related deaths [6, 7]. Cancer-associated dysfunctions of AR, such as aberrant activation due to mutations, amplification, splicing and cross talk with other pro-cancer signaling pathways contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) development and progression [1–5, 8]. In clinical practice, androgen ablation continues to be the corner stone for the treatment of advanced CaP [7, 9–11]. Unfortunately, androgen ablation treated CaPs eventually become treatment resistant, the stage of the disease known as castration resistant CaP (CRPC). Altered AR expression or function (gain or loss) resulting from genomic or non-genomic mechanisms associate with CRPC [1–5]. In contrast to other aspects of AR alterations, only a few studies have addressed how AR protein turnover is altered in CaP [12, 13]. A shorter half-life of AR was noted in the androgen responsive LNCaP cells as compared to its longer half life in the androgen refractory derivative C4–2B cells [14]. Early reports of the mechanisms of AR degradation showed that MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase targeted the AR through AKT mediated phosphorylation of MDM2 [15]. Our studies have implicated NEDD4 E3 ligase in AR degradation [16–19]. Studies have also described downregulation of AR by proteasome dependent degradation during mitosis suggesting AR as a licensing factor for DNA replication in CaP cells [20, 21]. Emerging data also suggests for the role of other E3 ubiquitin ligases (CHIP, SKP2, Siah2, RNF6) in the AR degradation or transcriptional activation [13]. A recent report showed that SPOP E3 ubiquitin ligase degrades AR protein and the recurrent genomic mutations of the SPOP noted in 5–10% of CaPs impair the SPOP mediated AR degradation [22, 23].

PMEPA1 was originally identified by our laboratory as a prostate abundant, highly androgen induced gene that mapped to chromosome 20q13.31-q13.33 [16]. Human PMEPA1 protein exhibits 83% amino acid identity to the mouse Nedd4-bindng protein, N4wbp4 [16, 24]. PMEPA1 is a direct transcriptional target of AR in CaP cells [18]. Further Investigations discovered a PMEPA1- AR negative feedback loop in the regulation of AR protein levels in CaP cells [19]. Members of the NEDD4 family of proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases, which catalyze degradation of target proteins of physiologically important functions by the ubiquitin-prosteasome pathway [25, 26]. Initial evaluations of PMEPA1 mRNA expression in matched normal and prostate tumor specimens suggested decreased expression of PMEPA1 in two-third of CaP patients [17]. In contrast to CaPs, higher expression of PMEPA1 has been noted in multiple solid tumors [27, 28]. Studies have also shown induction of PMEPA1 expression by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) that was associated with colonocyte terminal differentiation [29]. Subsequent studies have defined that PMEPA1 inhibits TGF-β receptor 1 meditated signaling through a negative feedback loop by sequestering R-Smads [30]. Increased PMEPA1 expression in breast and lung cancer may lead to inhibition of TGF-β signaling [31–33]. PMEPA1 has also been reported to promote the proliferation of AR negative CaP cells, PC3, through the Smad3–4/C-MYC/p21Cip1 pathway [34, 35]. Taken together, both reduced and increased PMEPA1 expression may promote tumorigenesis through distinct cell signaling pathways in a given cellular background.

In this report, we present new findings on the cancer biologic properties of decreased PMEPA1 expression. Loss or decreased PMEPA1 expression in CaP contributes to accelerated cell growth through increased AR and NEDD4, decreased PTEN levels and confers resistance to AR inhibitors used in androgen ablation therapy.

RESULTS
Inhibition of PMEPA1 promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells
We have examined the impact of PMEPA1 depletion on tumor growth in vivo. We have characterized PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP and PMEPA1shRNA-VCaP stable transfectants to assess the growth of prostate tumor cells in vitro. We observed enhanced cancer cell biologic features by monitoring cell growth, BrdU incorporation, cell plating efficiency, soft agar colony formation, growth response to androgen and cell cycle (Supplementary Figure 1).

We evaluated the tumor growth characteristics of PMEPA1shRNA harboring LNCaP cells in athymic nude mouse tumor xenograft model. The PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP and control shRNA-LNCaP cells began to form subcutaneous tumors at 4 weeks post-injection. The overall growth of PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP derived tumors was significantly faster than control derived tumors (p < 0.05) (Figure 1A). At 9 week post-injection among 20 mice in each group, 18 mice formed measurable subcutaneous tumors in the PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP group. In contrast, only 12 mice formed tumors in the control group. The tumor formation rate was 90% in the PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP group and only 60% in the control. The average tumor volume was 2246.04 mm3 for PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP and 1211.64 mm3 for the control. PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP tumors expressed higher levels of AR and PSA proteins compared to control cells as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 1B and Table 1). The tumor size in the control group decreased 21% at two weeks post-injection in response to castration. In contrast, PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP xenografts were refractory to castration. By seven weeks post-castration, the overall tumor size was four times larger than the initial tumor size (100%) in PMEPA1shRNA harboring xenografts (increased by 304%), in contrast to the control group (increased by 69%) (p < 0.05) (Figure 1C). Taken together, both in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics of PMEPA1shRNA harboring cells resulted in increased AR, gain of AR function and accelerated tumor growth under normal, as well as under castrate conditions.

(C) Castration attenuates the growth of LNCaP tumors in vivo, in contrast, PMEPA1shRNA harboring tumors continue to grow at accelerated rate (p < 0.05).

PMEPA1 depletion leads to resistance to AR inhibitors
To further investigate the role of decreased PMEPA1 levels in enhancing tumor cell growth by gain of AR function, dose and time kinetic response to the AR inhibitors, enzalutamide and bicalutamide were assessed in cell growth assays. PMEPA1 depletion conferred resistance to AR inhibitors in both LNCaP and VCaP cells (Figure 2A and 2B, Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). Additionally, enhanced resistance to AR inhibitors was confirmed by BrdU incorporation, soft agar colony formation and cell plating efficiency assays (Supplementary Figure 2C–2E). Consistent with these observations, cell cycle analysis showed higher number of cells in S-phase and decreased rate of apoptosis in response to PMEPA1 inhibition (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 2F). The observed enhanced resistance to AR inhibitors in response to PMEPA1 depletion was consistent with the observed castration resistance of PMEPA1shRNA harboring tumor xenografts. Taken together, these data suggest that loss or decreased PMEPA1 levels confers resistance to AR inhibitors.

(A and B) In contrast to control cells, increased percentages to initial cell numbers (2 × 105 cells/6 cm dish) were detected in PMEPA1shRNA harboring LNCaP and VCaP cells in response to enzalutamide (ENZ) treatment at dosages of 10 or 25 μM for 5 or 10 days (p < 0.05).

PMEPA1 silencing rescues AR inhibition in prostate cancer cells
In hormone sensitive CaP cells, decreased AR expression levels results in reduced cell growth. However, under this condition, loss of PMEPA1 may supersede the growth effect of AR inhibition by stabilizing AR at protein levels. Thus, we evaluated if inhibition of PMEPA1 can restore CaP cell growth overriding the inhibition of AR. Indeed, co-transfection of AR and PMEPA1 siRNAs in LNCaP cells reversed effects of AR depletion by siRNA on AR protein (Figure 3A). While parental LNCaP cells exhibited severe growth inhibition in response to AR siRNA, simultaneous knockdown of PMEPA1 rescued the growth of cancer cells (Figure 3B). These data further supported that the observed enhanced cell proliferation in response to PMEPA1 depletion was due to elevated AR protein levels and AR signaling.

Figure 3 PMEPA1 silencing rescues AR inhibition in prostate cancer cells
(A) Western blot assay shows that AR siRNA (AR si) efficiently decreased protein levels of AR and PMEPA1 when compared to control (NT si). Co-transfection of AR and PMEPA1 siRNA in LNCaP cells reversed effects of the AR depletion by siRNA on AR protein. (B) Cell counting assay reveals that PMEPA1 siRNA (PMEPA1 si) reversed the cell growth inhibition cause by AR siRNA in LNCaP cells (p < 0.01).

Disruption of AR and NEDD4 link by loss of PMEPA1
It was intriguing to note simultaneous increase of NEDD4 and AR in response to PMEPA1 knockdown (Figure 4A). This observation suggested that inhibition of PMEPA1 may disrupt interaction between NEDD4 and AR. This observation was also supported by marked stabilization of AR in LNCaP cells harboring ectopically expressed NEDD4 in the background of PMEPA1 knockdown (Figure 4B). Further, decreases in AR levels in response to ectopic PMEPA1 expression were abolished by NEDD4 knockdown in LNCaP cells (Figure 4C). As expected, the cell growth read out reflected the AR status (Figure 4B and 4C). Conversely, ectopic expression of NEDD4 in PMEPA1 shRNA stable transfectants was refractory to AR biochemical signals and associated features (Figure 4D). These findings established that both PMEPA1 and NEDD4 are essential in AR mediated cell growth.

Figure 4 AR and NEDD4 link is disrupted by the loss of PMEPA1
(A)
PMEPA1 knockdown increases protein levels of NEDD4, AR and PSA in LNCaP cells as shown by Western blot assay. (B) Knockdown of PMEPA1 stabilizes AR (Western blot assay, left panel) and overrides the growth inhibitory effect of ectopically expressed NEDD 4 (cell counting assay, right panel; p < 0.01). (C)
NEDD4 siRNA stabilizes AR (Western blot assay, left panel) and reverses the cell growth inhibitory (cell counting assay, right panel) effect of PMEPA1 overexpression (p < 0.01). (D) Elevated expression of NEDD4 alone does not affect AR and PSA protein levels (Western blot assay, left panel) or cell growth (cell counting assay, right panel; p < 0.05) in PMEPA1shRNA harboring LNCaP transfectants.

NEDD4 down-regulates AR protein levels and inhibits cell growth in hormone responsive prostate cancer cells
Our previous study has revealed that PMEPA1 binds to NEDD4 through the interaction between PY motifs of PMEPA1 and WW domain of human NEDD4 protein [17]. Thus, we evaluated the role of NEDD4 on CaP cell growth and AR protein levels. Knockdown of NEDD4 by specific siRNA led to strikingly elevated levels of AR and PSA in LNCaP and VCaP cells (Figure 5A). Conversely, ectopic expression of the NEDD4 resulted in decreased levels of AR protein in both LNCaP and VCaP cells (Figure 5B). Further, ectopic expression of NEDD4 resulted in a significant inhibition of cell growth (Figure 5C and 5D). In parallel, we also evaluated the effects MDM2 E3 ligase on AR which has been reported to be involved in AR degradation [15]. As expected, transfection of the MDM2 siRNA, resulted in elevated AR and PSA protein levels in both LNCaP and VCaP cells (Figure 5E and 5F). Taken together, these findings underscored that NEDD4 mediates AR degradation and cell growth inhibition in hormone responsive VCaP and LNCaP cells.

Figure 5 NEDD4 down-regulates of AR protein level and AR signaling, as well as inhibits the growth of LNCaP and VCaP cells
(A) Inhibition of NEDD4 by siRNA (NEDD4 si1 and si2) enhances AR and PSA protein levels in LNCaP and VCaP cells. (B) Ectopic expression of NEDD4 decreases AR and PSA in LNCaP and VCaP cells. (C) Cell counting assay reveals that NEDD4 siRNA (NEDD4 si1 and si2) increases the growth of LNCaP cells (p < 0.05). (D) Conversely, ectopic expression of NEDD4 inhibits the growth of LNCaP cells (p < 0.05) as shown by cell counting assay. (E) As expected, MDM2 siRNA (MDM2 si1 and si2) also increases AR and PSA protein levels in LNCaP and VCaP cells.

NEDD4 facilitates PTEN degradation in PMEPA1 depleted cells
Genomic deletions and reduced expression of PTEN is frequently noted in CaPs which correlates with adverse pathologic features [36]. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PTEN by NEDD4 has been reported [37, 38]. As noted, above PMEPA1 depletion in CaP cells also resulted in elevated NEDD4 levels. Thus, we reasoned that decreased PMEPA1 may contribute to reduced levels of PTEN, a known NEDD4 target in CaP cells. In VCaP cells harboring wild type PTEN, ectopic expression of NEDD4 down-regulates PTEN protein levels (Figure 6A). Moreover, the PMEPA1 knockdown led to elevated levels of AR protein, increased NEDD4 and decreased PTEN protein levels (Figure 6B). These findings suggest that loss of PMEPA1 may contribute to the defects of PTEN and alterations in NEDD4 through AR that is consistent with reported associations of PTEN and AR with CaP progression [36]. Thus, PMEPA1 may in part also affects NEDD4 mediated PTEN degradation in the context of androgen responsive CaP cells. However, NEDD4 can target PTEN independent of AR or PMEPA1. Ectopically expressed PTEN directly interacting with AR, has been shown to facilitate AR degradation and to inhibit AR nuclear translocation in PTEN null LNCaP cells [39]. Due to this reciprocal relationship between AR and PTEN, we evaluated the cooperative effects of PTEN knockdown and PMEPA1 depletion on cell growth, AR levels and AR transcriptional targets. Transfection of VCaP cells with PMEPA1 or PTEN siRNA resulted in enhanced cell growth, increased levels of AR and its targets, PSA and NEDD4. Cells depleted in both PMEPA1 and PTEN led to further increases in AR and cell growth (Figure 6C and 6D). Cumulatively, loss or reduced expression of PMEPA1 may lead to higher levels of AR and decreased levels of PTEN resulting in a feedforward enhancement in cell growth as shown in simultaneous depletion of PMEPA1 and PTEN.

Figure 6 NEDD4 facilitates PTEN degradation in PMEPA1 depleted cells
(A) Western blot assay shows that overexpression of NEDD4 decreases PTEN in VCaP cells at 24 and 72 hours post transfection. (B) Inhibition of PMEPA1 by siRNA upregulates NEDD4 and AR, and results in decreases in PTEN protein levels in VCaP cells. (C) Simultaneous knockdown of PMEPA1 and PTEN leads to elevated AR and PSA levels and (D) enhanced cell growth (p < 0.01). (E) Model depicting three major consequences of PMEPA1 depletion in CaP cells such as increased cell growth, resistances to AR inhibitors and decrease PTEN protein level.

Higher ratio of PSA to PMEPA1 expression as a surrogate for increased AR function associates with more aggressive prostate cancer cells
The frequently observed silencing of PMEPA1 in CaP may result in stabilization of AR, leading to higher levels of AR and increased AR transcription factor activity. To assess this finding in human CaP specimens, laser capture micro-dissected matched benign and cancer epithelium derived RNA samples were evaluated for quantitative expression of PMEPA1 and PSA/KLK3 mRNA, a surrogate for AR transcriptional activation function, in frozen radical prostatectomy derived specimens from 82 patients. The experiment revealed a correlation of decreased PMEPA1 mRNA expression with increased PSA/KLK3 expression levels. The ratio of PSA and PMEPA1 T/N expression values in each patient was correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics. Higher PSA/PMEPA1 expression ratio significantly associated with multiple indicators of disease progression (tumor differentiation, margin status, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion (Table 3). Thus, increased AR function as reflected by increased PSA/KLK3 expression along with reduced PMEPA1 expression associate with progressive CaP.

DISCUSSION
It is well recognized that the alterations (gain or loss) of the AR mediated signaling, play critical roles in the development and progression of CaP. While AR has been extensively studied for alterations of its structure, expression and transcriptional functions in CaP, defects of the AR protein degradation in CaP warrant careful evaluations. Better understanding of mechanisms controlling AR protein levels may also help in developing new therapeutic strategies focusing on AR degradation in a majority of metastatic CaP associating with the gain of AR function.

Cumulative data underscore the association of reduced or absent PMEPA1 expression in CaP cells with increased AR due to impaired AR degradation [17–19]. However, the impact of attenuated PMEPA1 expression in the interface of NEDD4, AR and PTEN in CaP biology and the effects on therapeutic AR inhibitors has not been examined before. Three major consequences of loss of PMEPA1 in CaP are summarized in the working model (Figure 6E). First, PMEPA1 knockdown accelerated the growth of LNCaP tumors in athymic nude mouse and in cell culture models. Second, PMEPA1 knockdown resulted in enhanced resistance to both enzalutamide and bicalutamide inhibitors of AR. Third, we noted that PMEPA1 silencing increased NEDD4-mediated downregulation of PTEN, further enhancing the growth of CaP cells. In agreement with cell culture models, in human CaP specimens decreased PMEPA1 expression correlated with increased AR transcriptional function as measured by PSA/KLK3 mRNA expression.

One of the new findings of this study is the androgen induction of NEDD4 E3 ligase that may impose additional level of hormonal control on AR and PTEN degradation (Supplementary Figure 3A–3C). Previous studies reported androgen induction of NEDD4L transcripts [40]. Informatics analysis of regulatory elements in the NEDD4 gene locus indicated the presence of a cluster of androgen responsive elements (Supplementary Figure 3D).

Of note, this study also provides novel findings of cooperation between PMEPA1 and PTEN defects leading to enhanced CaP cell growth. While PMEPA1 depletion uncouples NEDD4 from AR degradation, increased levels of NEDD4 remains available for PTEN degradation, leading to simultaneous gain of AR and loss of PTEN in CaP cells. Evaluating the mechanism of PMEPA1 silencing in previous studies we have shown that methylation of the first intronic DNA region of PMEPA1 gene is a prevalent mechanism of PMEPA1 silencing in human prostate CaP [41]. In conclusion, this study highlights that silencing of PMEPA1 accelerates the growth of CaP cells through AR, NEDD4 and PTEN. Taken together, these data provide support for the dual impact of PMEPA1 restoration as a complementary approach in correcting for AR and PTEN defects in CaP and highlights biomarker potential of monitoring PMEPA1 during androgen ablation therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and related reagents
LNCaP and VCaP cells (from ATCC, Manassas VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 and DMEM growth medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For the androgen-depletion experiments, cells were grown in 10% charcoal stripped FBS supplemented cell growth medium for 5 days. Subsequently, cells were treated with various dosages (0 nM, 0.1 nM, 1.0 nM and 10.0 nM) of synthetic androgen R1881 (Cat#NLP005005MG, Perkin Elmer Life Science, Waltham, MA) for indicated time. Hexamethrine bromide (Cat#H9268–5G) and puromycin (Cat#A1113802) used for selection PMEPA1 shRNA lentivirus transfectants were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Plasmids, small interfering (si) RNAs and shRNA lentiviruses
The mammalian plasmids used were as follows: pcDNA3.1 as vehicle control, pcDNA3.1-PMEPA1, pCMV-AR (wild-type) and pCMV-AR (mutant T877A) were described before (15, 37); pCMV-XL4 (vehicle control, Cat#PCMV6XL4) and pCMV-XL4-NEDD4 (Cat#SC107811) were purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD). The siRNAs for various genes were all purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Each gene of interest was targeted with two different siRNAs (Supplementary 4A–4C) using optimal concentrations that were determined in pilot assays: PMEPA1 siRNA1: GTTATCACCACGTATATA; PMEPA1 siRNA2: 5′-GCATCAGCGCCACGTGCTA-3′; NEDD4 siRNA1: 5′-TGCAGAACAGGCTGAGGAA-3′; NEDD4 siRNA2 ATGAAACTTCGCCGAGCAA; AR siRNA1: 5′-GCAAAGGTTCTCTGCTAGA-3′; AR siRNA2: 5′-TCGAGGCCCTGTAACTTG-3′; MDM2 siRNA1: 5′-GCCACAAATCTGATAGTA-3′; MDM2 siRNA2: 5′-GAAGTTATTAAAGTCTGTT-3′; PTEN siRNA1: 5′-GTATAGAGCGTGCAGATAA-3′; PTEN siRNA2: 5′-GTTAGCAGAAACAAAAGGAGATATCAA-3′. The co-transfection was conducted with PMEPA1 siRNA1, AR siRNA2 and PTEN siRNA2. The non-targeting control siRNA pool (Cat#D-001206–13–50) was also purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The Mission shRNA lentiviral transduction particles (Non-Target, Cat#SHC002V and PMEPA1, Cat#SHCLNV and Clone ID: TRCN0000272494) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The targeting sequence of PMEPA1 shRNA1 was 5′-GAGCAAAGAGAAGGATAAACA-3′, and PMEPA1 shRNA2 was 5′-GAGTTTGTTCAGATCATCATC-3′. The transfection of plasmids or small interfering RNA were performed following the standard protocol of lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA). The infection of mission shRNA lentiviruses transduction particles and selection of positive colonies were performed as recommended by the supplier.

Cell counting assays
The CaP cells (LNCaP and VCaP cells) were seeded in 6 cm culture dishes at the density of 2 × 105 cells/dish. Cells were grown at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2 days followed by transfection with plasmids (pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-PMEPA1, pCMV-XL4, pCMV-XL4-NEDD4 or pCMV-XL4-AR) or siRNA (non-targeting, PMEPA1, AR, NEDD4 or PTEN siRNA) using lipofectamine 2000 procedure. The AR inhibitors treatment experiments were conducted with PMEPA1 shRNA1 harboring LNCaP and VCaP cells. The transfected cells or the stable transfectants were harvested at indicated time points post-transfection with 0.25% trypsin plus EDTA (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were re-suspended into 10 ml regular medium, and 10 μl of single cell suspension was applied to hemocytometer for cell counting with trypan blue (Cat#72–57-1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Cell cycle analysis by fluorescence activated cell sorting
Ten million cells of PMEPA1 shRNA transfectant LNCaP or VCaP cells were harvested by centrifugation at 180 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 300 μl PBS (pH 7.4), and 5 ml methanol was added drop-wise and vortexed at low speed. The fixed cells were incubated in methanol at −20°C for 30 min. After removing the methanol cells were stained by propidium iodide dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at final concentration of 60 μg/ml containing 50 μg/ml RNaseA in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 30 min and were processed for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.

Western blot analysis
The cells were harvested with M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Cat#78501, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Cat#P8340, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Cat#P-0044, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cell lysates were analyzed using Western blot procedures described in details in the Supplementary Methods.

Antibodies
Antibodies used for Western blot assay were as follows: anti-AR rabbit polyclonal antibody (N-20, Cat#sc-816, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-PMEPA1 mouse monoclonal antibody (2A12, Cat#H00056937-M01, ABNOVA, Taiwan); anti-NEDD4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cat#07–049, Millipore, Billerica, MA); anti-PTEN mouse monoclonal antibody (Cat#MS-1601-S0, Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), anti-PSA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cat#A05662, Dako, Denmark); anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody (FL335, Cat#sc-25778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse TrueBlot antibodies (Cat#18–8816, Cat#18–8817-33, eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay were: anti-PMEPA1 antibody mentioned above, anti-AR mouse monoclonal antibody (M3562, DAKO, Denmark), anti-PSA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cat#A0562, DAKO, Denmark), biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody (Cat# BA-2000, Vector, Burlingame, CA), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cat# BA-1000, Vector, Burlingame, CA) and VIP peroxidase (HRP) substrate kit (Cat# SK-4600, Vector, Burlingame, CA).

Athymic nude mouse tumorigenicity assay
Ten weeks old athymic Ncr-nu/nu mice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) were evaluated in tumor xenografts derived from PMEPA1 shRNA LNCaP and control-shRNA LNCaP cells. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in accordance with established NIH guideline under the animal protocol approved by Uniformed Services of University of the Health Sciences, Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. A total of 40 athymic nude mice were subdivided into two groups: control-shRNA LNCaP and PMEPA1-shRNA LNCaP with 20 mice in each group. Transfectant cells were resuspended in RPMI1640 medium mixed with 50% matrigel (Cat#354234, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Each mouse received 4 × 106 cells in 200 μl medium by subcutaneous injection to right frank side. Injected mice were monitored for tumor formation twice per week post injection. The end point of the experiment represented tumor diameter of 1.5 cm or 6 weeks after xenograft tumor formation. The excised tumor tissue was fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded and sectioned for 5 μm slides for Hematoxylin and Eosin stain and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for PMEPA1, AR and PSA. Total 10 foci with 20X magnification were randomly examined from each IHC staining slides for quantitative analysis with ImageJ software (version 1.48, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The IHC procedures were described in details in the Supplementary Methods.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RNA laser capture microdissected matched normal and prostate tumor specimens as described in Sterbis et al [42]. PCR primers and Taqman probes were as follows: PMEPA1, 5′-CATGATCCCCGAGCTGCT-3′ (forward), 5′-TGATCTGAACAAACTCCAGCTCC-3′ (reverse), and 6FAM-5′-AGGCGGACAGTCTCCTGCGAAACC-3′-TAMRA (probe); PSA/KLK3, 5′-CCCACTG CATCAGGAACAAA-3′ (forward), 5′-GAGCGGGTGTG GGAAGCT-3′ (reverse), and 6FAM-5′-ACACAGGCCAG GTATTTCAGGTCAGCC-3′-TAMRA (probe). The expression of GAPDH served as an endogenous control measured in the same tube as the target gene (GAPDH control mix, Applied Biosystems). Target gene expression in each sample was normalized to GAPDH. Results were plotted as average Ct (cycle threshold) values of duplicate samples. Relative gene expression level was presented as dCt in tumor versus matched benign cells, where dCt represents normalized Ct value of target genes to GAPDH. Statistical analysis of quantitative expression of PMEPA1 and PSA mRNA was evaluated in 82 patients (164 tumor and matched normal samples). The sample size (N = 82) was determined by statistical power calculation (90% power with 0.05 alpha, two sided Chi-square test). Distributions of other clinico-pathological variables were examined by using Chi-square or Fisher exact tests.

Statistical analysis
If not otherwise stated, significant was calculated utilizing an unpaired t-test. Data are calculated as mean ±SEM or +SEM.

Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation that potentially leads to organ damage. Severe manifestations make the management of SLE difficult and challenging. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive and citotoxic agents are the mainstays of treatment. Unfortunately, these agents are related to a vast toxicity. For an amount of patients, these approaches arent enough to achieve disease activity control, especially in those with cytopenia, nephritis and neuropsychiatric lupus. For these cases, Rituximab (RTX) – a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody specific for human CD20 B-cell – has been widely prescribed. It is known that B-cells have a central role in SLE pathogenesis, being precursors of plasma cells production autoantibodies, precipitating inflammation by producing cytokines, activation T-cells by presentation of self-antigens, and regulating T-cells activity via co-stimulatory molecules. Although the clinical trials of RTX in SLE had controversial results, RTX seems to be a valuable option as an off-label drug for refractory patients.

Objectives
To report the experience of a tertiary pediatric rheumatology center with RTX for patients with refractory SLE.

Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with SLE that received RTX in some moment of their disease from September 2009 to February 2013 due to refractory to traditional therapies. A satisfactory response was defined as reaching SLEDAI reduction in at least 50%, urina protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) <50 mg/mmol (equivalent to proteinuria <0.5g/24h), and corticoid tapering to at least 50% of inicial dose.

Results
Seven patients were in use of the medication in the revised period. All of then were female. Six patients had the diagnosis of lupus nephritis, and 1 had refractory plaquetopenia to standart drugs. Two patients had an inadequate response to RTX. One of them persisted with refractory plaquetopenia and the other died due to complications related to SLE. Out of the 6 patients with lupus nephritis, 4 (66%) achieved SLEDAI reduction of at least 50% after 4-6 months of RTX, as well showed an important reduction of proteinuria (<0.5g/24h) and corticoid tapering. One patient had improvement of her disease, however without achieving the paramethers of satisfactory response to the RTX. For this reason, this patient was considered to have a partial response to the RTX. The results are according to those found in similar studies.

Conclusion
It is suggested that RTX continues to be used as a therapeutic option for patients with refractory SLE or with contraindication to traditional drugs. Prospected studies are still needed to evaluate efficacy and safety of RTX in pediatric patients.

However, its expression in fungi remains to be explored. To understand its expression in mushroom fungi, the PAL gene of the edible mushroom Flammulina velutipes (Fvpal) was cloned and characterized. The cloned Fvpal consists of 2,175 bp, coding for a polypeptide containing 724 amino acids and having 11 introns. The translated amino acid sequence of Fvpal shares a high identity (66%) with that of ectomycorrhizal fungus Tricholoma matsutake. Distinctively, the Fvpal expression in the mycelium was higher in minimal medium supplemented with L-tyrosine than with other aromatic amino acids. During cultivation of the mushroom on sawdust medium, Fvpal expression in the fruit body correspondingly increased as the mushroom grew. In the fruiting body, Fvpal was expressed more in the stipe than in the pileus. These results suggest that F. velutipes PAL activity differs in the different organs of the mushroom. Overall, this is first report to show that the PAL gene expression is associated with mushroom growth in fungi.

==== Body
Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, E.C. 4.3.1.24) is the enzyme that dissociates ammonia from L-phenylalanine and produces trans-cinnamic acid. The conversion of the amino acid phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid is the entry step for the channeling of carbon from primary metabolism into the phenylpropanoid secondary metabolism in plants. PAL performs an important role in deriving secondary metabolites, being involved in development, differentiation and growth of plants. Though there have been a lot of studies for the role of PAL in plants, its function in fungi remains unknown. The discovery of a PAL enzyme in fungi [1] and the detection of 14CO2 production from 14C-ring-labeled phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, and benzoic acid [2], have demonstrated that fungal PAL can degrade phenylalanine by a pathway involving an initial deamination to cinnamic acid, similar to what happens in plants. Consequently, a metabolic role for the metabolism of phenylalanine via cinnamic, benzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and protocatechuic acids has been assumed in several basidiomycete fungi, including Rhodotorula glutinis [3], Schizophyllum commune [2], and Sporobolomyces roseus [4]. In the phytopathogenic fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, PAL accumulated during the necrotrophic phase of infection in plant tissues, implying the enzyme might be involved in pathogenicity [5]. Recently, diverse physiological roles were also inferred in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Tricholoma matsutake, from the observation that PAL mRNA expression was dependent on the developmental stage [6].

The white-rot fungus Flammulina velutipes belongs to the order Agaricales in the phylum Basidiomycota. It is known as the winter mushroom, and is one of the six most actively cultivated mushrooms in the world; over 300,000 tons of this mushroom are produced per year [7]. Its distribution is limited to the temperate zones of the world because a cold period is required for fruiting [8]. The wild F. velutipes mushroom has a dark brown fruit body. But through breeding, long and thin mushroom cultivars with white fruit body have been developed. Korea exports this edible mushroom to 27 countries, including the USA, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Australia. With the findings that F. velutipes has strong immuno-modulatory and anti-tumoral activities [9, 10], the benefits of this mushroom have received more attention.

In an effort to understand the function of PAL in F. velutipes, this study was done to clone the PAL gene and characterize its expression in the fruiting body at major development stages during cultivation, and in the mycelium grown in media supplemented with aromatic amino acids.

For PAL gene cloning, RNA sequence data of F. velutipes was collected from our previous studies [11, 12]. By the analysis of the RNA pool derived from the F. velutipes mycelium and comparison of the RNA pool data to the genome sequence of Coprinopsis cinerea, we found a sequence of 2,172 bp PAL gene candidate. We named this candidate gene as a potent F. velutipes PAL gene (Fvpal), and planned to verify whether this potent Fvpal truly existed in the cell of F. velutipes. Thus, we cloned and re-sequenced the open reading frame sequences of Fvpal mRNA from F. velutipes 4146 strain. For this purpose, mycelia of the fungal strain grown on malt extract agar was ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was prepared from the resulting mycelia powder using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The prepared RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primers using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis-System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting cDNA (100 ng for each reaction) was used for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify the potent Fvpal of F. velutipes. A primer set of Fvpal-F (5'-ATG CCT TCA GAA CTC TTC GAC CTC-3') and Fvpal-R (5'-CTA GAG CTT GCT GCG AGG CA-3') was designed based on the potent Fvpal sequence from the previous RNA sequence data, and used for RT-PCR. Amplifying reaction was performed using FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Basel, Swiss) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95oC for 5min followed by 30 cycles of 45 sec at 95℃, 45 sec at 58℃, and 2 min at 72℃. The amplified RT-PCR product was sequenced at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea).

A nucleotide sequence of 2,175 bp with termination codon sequence was determined. The determined sequence contained a protein coding sequence that matched 100% with the potent Fvpal nucleotide sequence (data not shown). This result confirmed that the potent Fvpal is truly present in the cell of F. velutipes. Consequently, we further analyzed the potent Fvpal sequence using Expasy bioinformatics resource portal (http://web.expasy.org). A protein coding sequence of 724 amino acids was inferred from the potent 2,172 bp Fvpal sequence. The PAL signature motif containing the enzyme active site, a serine residue that is unique in eukaryotic PAL [13], was present in the protein sequence of the potent Fvpal (Table 1). A BLASTP search of the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) using the translated amino acid sequences of Fvpal revealed that it had 35% to 66% sequence identity with those of known fungal species (Table 1). Thus, we concluded that the potent Fvpal is a true PAL gene that codes for F. velutipes PAL protein (Fvpal).

The Fvpal shared the highest sequence identity (66%) with Tricholoma matsutake PAL. The presence of intron in PAL genes is known in some fungi [14]. Thus, we investigated for the presence of intron in Fvpal. For this purpose, genomic DNA was extracted from the mycelium of F. velutipes using the method described by Kim et al. [15], and used as the template DNA for PCR amplification of Fvpal. Using the same amplification condition for RT-PCR and FvpalF and Fvpal-R primer set, a PCR product of 2,746 bp was obtained, cloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and sequenced. Nested primer Fvpalns- F (5'-AGC ATC TCA GCC TCC GGA GA-3') and Fvpalns- R (5'-GAG GAG GTA GAG GTA CGA GGA-3') was used for sequencing.

The determined nucleotide sequence contained a coding sequence (2,172 bp) and eleven interrupting sequences (totally 571 bp). The coding sequence was the same as the sequence of Fvpal. Thus, we discovered that Fvpal contains eleven introns (Table 1). Because only the PAL gene of the rust pathogen Puccinia graminis has more than eleven introns [14], Fvpal was considered as one of exons with a high number of introns in fungi. We deposited the sequence of Fvpal to GenBank with the accession number KF737393 (Table 1).

To understand the phylogenetic relationship between Fvpal and other fungal PALs, phylogenetic analysis was performed. All reference PAL protein sequences of twelve other fungal species were obtained from the GenBank database. The plant PAL sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana was used as an outgroup. Phylogenetic tree, based on fungal PAL protein sequences, was constructed using the maximum likelihood method by MEGA6 [16, 17]. 1,000 bootstrapping was performed to support the tree branch. The Fvpal formed a clad with those of Basidiomycota (Fig. 1). Among Basidiomycota, the Fvpal formed a group with those of Coprinopsis cinerea, Laconia bicolor, and T. matsutake, that typically produce mushroom as their fruit body. This result of phylogenetic relationships agreed with the result of PAL protein sequence identity between F. velutipes and the three mushroom species (Table 1).

Gene transformation with a gene knock vector is a useful approach to explore the function of genes in fungi, but it is still not feasible in the edible mushroom F. velutipes. Therefore, to understand Fvpal properties, we examined the expression properties of the Fvpal gene in both the mycelium and fruit body, using real time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) method. With regards to the mycelium, the effect of aromatic amino acid on Fvpal expression was examined because there were reports that PAL induction is regulated by aromatic amino acid or nitrogen sources [14]. Thus, F. velutipes 4146 strain was cultured in mushroom minimal media (MMM: 20 g/L dextrose, 0.5 g/L MgSO4, 0.46 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L K2HPO4, 2 g/L DL-asparagine, 120 µg/L thiamine HCl, 20 g/L agar) amended with each different amino acid (organic nitrogen source) or inorganic nitrogen source. For the amendment, the amino acid DL-asparagine in MMM was replaced with either L-phenylalanine (0.3 mM), L-tryptophan (0.3 mM), L-tyrosine (0.3 mM), or L-histidine (0.3 mM) as the amino acid, or with ammonium nitrate as an inorganic nitrogen (20 mM), respectively. The fungal mycelia were grown in each culture medium for 7 days at 25℃. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For the fruiting body, Fvpal expression was examined at different stages of mushroom development during artificial cultivation in sawdust media in bottles (Fig. 2). The mushroom development of F. velutipes was classified into five stages: mycelium, primordium, fruit body 1, fruit body 2, and fruit body 3 (Fig. 2). For expression analysis, the mushroom samples of fruit body stage 2 and 3 were divided into pileus and stipe, respectively.

For RT-qPCR analysis, total RNA and cDNA were prepared from both the mycelia and fruit body samples of F. velutipes, as described before. RT-qPCR reaction consisted of 12.5 µL of SYBR Premix Extaq (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), 100 ng cDNA and FvpalRT-F (5'-CTC GTT GAT ACG GGG GCA TTC-3') and FvpalRT-R (5'-GAA GGC AGA AGG TCC ATC GAA GA-3') primers. The threshold cycle (Ct) values, which represents the PCR cycle at which fluorescence passes the threshold, were determined using the software accompanying the TP800 [18]. For normalization of the real time RT-qPCR data, actin gene expression was used as the control at each time point. FvActin-F (5'-CCA TAG GTT TCT CTC TTC CTC AC-3') and FvActin-R (5'- CCA CGT TCC ATC AGG TTC TT-3') were used as F. velutipes actin gene specific primers. Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS ver. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). The significant differences between the group means were compared using Duncan's multiple range test. Differences at p < 0.05 were considered significant.

No significant difference was found in the growth F. velutipes mycelia among MMM amended with different amino acids (organic nitrogen source) or inorganic nitrogen source. However, Fvpal expression in mycelium was increased in the growth medium supplemented with ammonium nitrate, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan and L-tyrosine, than in media supplemented with L-histidine and control (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the maximum increase of Fvpal expression was found in medium supplemented with L-tyrosine, despite the fact that L-phenylalanine is the main substrate of PAL. Thus, it seems that Fvpal is not likely to be induced by a substrate-depended manner. Similarly, in the corn smut pathogen Ustilago maydis, PAL activity was also more induced in minimal medium amended with L-tryptophan [19]. In addition, it is noticeable that when it is compared to L-phenylalanine supplement, Fvpal expression enhanced more than 2-fold with ammonium nitrate supplement (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that the inorganic nitrogen source could induce the Flammulina mushroom PAL. Consequently, the induced PAL is expected to enhance the metabolic degradation of phenylalanine into t-cinnamic acid by its enzymatic function. Considering that ammonium nitrate differently affects the substrate digestibility and degradation in mushroom species [20], we cannot rule out that it could also be metabolically involved in the L-phenylalanine degradation process operated by PAL. If this case is proven, we could conclude that PAL has a metabolic role in the mycelium of F. velutipes. Further work is needed to explore the mechanism by which ammonium nitrate and L-tyrosine metabolically regulate the PAL gene expression in the mycelium of F. velutipes. So far, this is first demonstration in fungi that PAL gene expression is increased maximally with L-tyrosine supplement in the minimal medium.

The results of pal mRNA expression analysis during the fruiting body development of F. velutipes showed that the Fvpal was expressed most at the mycelium stage of fully covered mycelia, on the top of the cultivation bottle (Fig. 3B). The Fvpal expression gradually decreased as the fruit body developed from the mycelium stage to stage 1 (Fig. 3B). With the development of the fruit body from stage 1 (where the formation of mushroom shape was completed) (Fig. 2C) to stage 2 (where the mushroom elongated around 5 cm) (Fig. 2D), the Fvpal expression increased again (Fig. 3B). However, no more increase was found at stage 3, where the mushroom was elongated enough to be harvested for market sales (Figs. 2E and 3B). Interestingly, in the fruiting body of stage 2 and 3, the Fvpal expression was more in the stipe than in the pileus (Fig. 3B). These results imply that the deamination activity of ammonia from L-phenylalanine occurs in the stipe during the mushroom elongation. From Fig. 2C and 2D, we could consider the fruit body elongation as mushroom growth, which is similar to the growth of plants which is accompanied with elongation of the stems and leaves. In the context that PAL is involved in plant growth [21], we may state that PAL gene expression is associated with mushroom growth in F. velutipes. PAL gene expression in mushroom has been reported in button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) in response to stress [22], and in Tricholoma mushroom (T. matsutake) in different structural parts [6]. However, there has been no report on the comparative analysis of PAL gene expression in fungi in relation to mushroom growth. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first report of PAL gene expression during mushroom growth.

To summarize, the PAL gene of F. velutipes was cloned and its structural properties were characterized in this study. With real time RT-qPCR, we found that the Fvpal expression in the mycelium is greatly influenced by Ltyrosine supplement in the minimal medium, which is a distinct property that has not been reported in other fungi. These results suggest that the metabolic role(s) of the F. velutipes PAL could be different from those of other fungal PALs. In addition, we are the first to provide evidence that PAL gene expression is associated with fruit body growth and development in fungi. Considering that a wide range of phenolic compounds which have diverse functions in plants are synthesized by PAL function through the phenylpropanoid pathway, there is a possibility that the F. velutipes PAL might also be involved in the production of phenolic compounds which perform some functions in the mushroom stipe during the mushroom growth. Thus, further studies are needed to analyze phenolic compounds produced in the fruit body during the development of F. velutipes mushroom.

http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html#termsThe vomeronasal organ (VNO) plays an essential role in intraspecies communication for terrestrial vertebrates. The ionic mechanisms of VNO activation remain unclear. We find that the calcium–activated potassium channel SK3 and G–protein activated potassium channel GIRK are part of an independent pathway for VNO activation. In slice preparations, the potassium channels attenuate inward currents carried by TRPC2 and calcium–activated chloride channels (CACCs). In intact tissue preparations, paradoxically, the potassium channels enhance urine–evoked inward currents. This discrepancy results from the loss of a high concentration of lumenal potassium, which enables the influx of potassium ions to depolarize the VNO neurons in vivo. SK3−/− and GIRK1−/− mice show deficits in both mating and aggressive behaviors and deficiency in SK3−/− is exacerbated by TRPC2 knockout. Our results suggest a model of VNO activation that is mediated by TRPC2, CACCs and two potassium channels, all contributing to the in vivo depolarization of VNO neurons.

INTRODUCTION
Sensory systems have evolved to represent salient features of an organism’s environment. In terrestrial vertebrates, the perception of olfactory cues is carried out by two anatomically and functionally distinct olfactory sensory systems: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). The MOE provides a broad sampling of the olfactory world and elicits a large number of cognitive and behavioral responses. In contrast, the VNO detects a distinct set of chemical cues, including pheromones that provide information about the sexual, social, and reproductive status of other members of the species. Pheromones recognized by the VNO trigger a restricted repertoire of innate behaviors and neuroendocrine responses such as mating rituals and territorial aggression 1.

The two systems have evolved independently to accommodate the unique requirements of the two olfactory senses. The main olfactory system primarily detects volatile, air–borne chemicals. Although the VNO may also respond to volatile odors, it mainly detects non–volatile chemicals including proteins and peptides 2. The vomeronasal system is strongly activated when the nose is in close contact with the pheromone sources, whereupon an active pumping mechanism is used to bring external cues into the VNO 3. Thus, the VNO neurons are likely to be exposed to various ionic environments where pheromones are found.

In the VNO, three distinct families of G–protein coupled receptors, V1Rs, V2Rs and the FPRs, are found to be expressed by the sensory neurons 4–10. Receptor occupancy activates phospholipase C (PLC) and results in elevating the levels of inositol 1,4,5–trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG) and their metabolites 11–14. These events are thought to lead to the activation of TRPC2, a member of the TRP superfamily of non–selective cation channels 15–17. Genetic knockout of the TRPC2 channel results in a significant loss of pheromone–triggered responses in VNO neurons and aberrant innate behaviors 18–20. Recent studies have shown that TRPC2 is not the sole ion channel mediating urine–evoked currents. Electrophysiological studies in hamster and mouse have identified a Ca2+–activated non–selective cation current in the VNO 21, 22. A Ca2+–activated Cl− current has been identified in mouse to mediate urine–evoked inward current 23. We have shown that the activation of the Cl− conductance is triggered by both Ca2+ entry through the TRPC2 channel and Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores 24.

In this study, we investigate the contribution of K+ channels in VNO signaling. We demonstrate that a significant contribution to the urine–evoked response derives from the activation of a small conductance Ca2+–activated K+ channel, SK3, as well as a G–protein activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel. We further show that the VNO mucus maintains an uncommon environment containing a high concentration of K+. This creates a gradient that results in an influx of K+ through the SK3 and GIRK channels in response to urine stimulation in vivo.

METHODS
Animals
Urine–evoked responses were obtained from 2–6 months old mice. 84 C57BL/6J, 15 SK3T/T, 30 TRPC2−/− and 25 GIRK1−/− animals were used. Approximately equal numbers of male and female mice were used. Animals were maintained in the Lab Animal Service Facility of Stowers Institute at 12:12 light cycle, and provided with food and water ad libitum. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stowers Institute and in compliance with NIH Guide for Care and Use of Animals.

TRPC2−/−, SK3T/T and GIRK1−/− mice were described previously 19, 27, 30. To generate SK3−/− mice, homozygote SK3T/T mice were placed on doxycycline diet and pups were weaned to doxycycline feed. GIRK1−/− mice were obtained from Dr. Kevin Wickman and colleagues 30.

In Situ Hybridization
The hybridization buffer contained 50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1X Denhardts, 250 µg/ml yeast tRNA, 500 µg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 0.1% Tween–20. Probes specific for mouse sk1, sk2 and sk3 were synthesized from the 3’ UTR of the respective genes using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche). In order to enhance sensitivity and reduce background, all antibody staining steps were performed in the presence of 0.1% Triton X–100, and the reaction was developed in buffer containing 0.1% Tween–20. Following alkaline phosphatase staining, the slides were coverslipped with Glycergel (DAKO) and viewed with Nomarski optics.

Immunofluorescent staining
Mouse VNO was dissected out and frozen in OCT Compound (Tissue–Tek). 12 µm coronal sections were collected on Superfrost slides (Fisher), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C, and washed three times in PT solution (0.1% Triton X–100 in PBS) at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against different proteins in PTS (1% goat serum in PT) at 4°C. Rabbit anti–SK3 and rabbit anti–GIRK1 antibodies were purchased from Alomone Labs in Israel. Guinea pig anti–TRPC2 antibodies used in Fig. 2 were generated as described previously 19. This particular batch of antibodies was lost. In subsequent stainings, rabbit anti–TRPC2 antibodies (a gift of Dr. Emily Liman) were used 15. Secondary antibodies that include: FITC–conjugated donkey anti–rabbit, Cy3–conjugated donkey anti–rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Lab), Alexa 488–conjugated donkey anti–rabbit, Alexa 546–conjugated donkey anti–guinea pig antibodies (Molecular Probes). Co–staining for SK3 and TRPC2 was conducted by mixing the rabbit anti–SK3 and the guinea pig anti–TRPC2 antibodies together. We were not able to perform double staining with GIRK1 and TRPC2 because the guinea pig anti–TRPC2 antibodies were no longer available.

Electrophysiology
Urine Samples
Urine samples were collected from mature male and female animals using the free–catch method. The freshly collected urine samples were frozen at −80°C until use for up to 3 months. Equal volumes of male and female urine were mixed and diluted to 1:100 in Ringer solutions for stimulation.

Slice preparation
Mice were killed by rapid cervical dislocation after CO2 asphyxiation. The VNOs were dissected out into mouse artificial cerebrospinal fluid (mACSF) that was continuously aerated with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 and maintained at 4°C. The tissue was embedded in a gel composed of 4% low melting point agarose prepared in mACSF and mounted on a specimen holder of the VF–300 microtome sectioning system (Precisionary Instruments). Tissue samples were sectioned into 200 µm slices, which were then transferred to mACSF solution continuously aerated with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 at room temperature. The composition of mACSF is (in mM): NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, NaHCO3 10, Na2HPO4 1.25, and Glucose (Dextrose) 10.

Patch Clamp Recordings
A VNO slice was placed in a recording chamber continuously superfused with oxygenated mACSF on an Olympus BX50WI upright microscope. An infrared DIC camera was used with a 40X objective to guide patch pipette to individual neurons. Patch clamp recording pipettes with resistance of 4–8 MΩ were fabricated using laser based P–2000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument).

Whole cell patch clamp
Recording was conducted using Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Device) with 10 KHz sampling rate and low–pass filtered at 100 Hz for voltage clamp experiments and 1 KHz for current clamp recordings. The plotted current traces were low pass filtered again at 20 Hz.

Current injection experiments were conducted under current clamp mode in whole cell configuration with the following step protocol. First five sweeps were applied with 1 pA increment from 0 to 4 pA, followed by a second five–sweeps with 3 pA increment from 5 to 17 pA and a third five–sweeps with 5 pA increment from 15 to 35 pA. Change in spike frequency was calculated by subtracting resting frequency during current injection.

Unless otherwise indicated, the pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): KCl 130, MgCl2 2, KOH 10, EGTA 1, HEPES 10, ATP 5, and GTP 0.3 in pH 7.2. For internal Cl− substitution experiments, KCl was substituted with potassium methanesulfonate (KMSF or KCH3SO3). For Cs+ internal solutions, KCl was replaced with CsCl at equal molar concentration. Fluorescein–conjugated dextran (10,000) at 50mM was sometimes included in the intracellular solution to label the recorded neurons. Holding potential was −60 mV. Urine was delivered for 15 seconds using a pressurized perfusion system (ALA–VM8, ALA Scientific Instruments). The tip of the perfusion head was placed approximately 500 µm away from the slice. The time course of the perfusion was measured using a solution that contained fluorescein. It took ~300 ms from the start of the delivery for the dye signal to reach plateau value. The 15 second delivery time mimicked the duration of a typical urogenital investigation episode for the mouse. For inhibitor experiments, VNO slice was incubated in mACSF containing 100 nM apamin, 100 nM tertiapin–Q, or 100 µm SCH23390 (Sigma–Aldrich) for one minute before urine stimulus was delivered.

Excised patch single channel recording
Patches were isolated from the dendritic knob region of VNO slices. HEKA EPC 10 patch–clamp amplifier (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY) and PULSE software were used for data acquisition with Clampfit 10 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for data analysis. 500 Hz 8–pole Butterworth filter was applied. Borosilicate recording pipettes were fabricated by P–2000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument) for 30–45 MΩ pipette resistance. Pipette solution contained (mM): 110 KMSF , 10 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA. Bath solution was used as the same pipette solution or K+ was substituted by Na+ if needed. The amount of calcium in bath solution was estimated using Ca–EGTA calculator (http://www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/CaEGTA–TS.htm).

EVG recordings
EVG was recorded from the microvillous surface of intact VNO sensory epithelia. The recording pipette (1–3 MΩ) was filled with solution B connected by an Ag/AgCl wire to a differential amplifier (DP–301, Warner Instruments). Solution B is consisted of (in mM): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.3 and 300 mOsm. A second Ag/AgCl wire was connected to an agar bridge served as an indifferent electrode. The output signal was digitized and low pass–filtered (8–pole Bessel; corner frequency 60 Hz).

Measurement of lumenal K+ concentration
To construct a K+ selective electrode, the patch clamp pipette (~1 MΩ) was filled to 0.5 mm with a K+ selective ion exchanger (World Precision Instruments), followed by the reference solution (500 mM KCl). A silver wire coated with AgCl was then immersed in the electrode solution and attached to AxonClamp 2A in order to measure the junction potential between the tip of the electrode and the sample solution. In addition, a ground electrode was connected through an AgCl− coated silver wire to the reference solution. Finally, the circuit was closed with a salt bridge connecting the sample with the reference solution. A series of standard solutions (1 mM to 500 mM KCl) was then measured to obtain the standard curve. In a dissected mouse head, the vomer bone was carefully removed to expose the VNO. The blood vessel that was covering the neuroepthilium was carefully removed to expose the underlying lumen of the VNO. Extra care was taken to ensure that no blood was contaminating the luminal surface. The exposed region was maintained under a stream of air saturated with water vapor to prevent drying of the tissue. It was then connected to the reference solution using a salt bridge. The K+ concentration was then calculated with the measured junction potential using the Nernst Equation:
 ΔV=RT/nFIn([K]ref/[K]s) 
where ΔV is the junction potential, [K]ref and [K]s are K+ concentrations of the reference solution and the sample, respectively. As control, the surface of the temporal lobe of the cortex was measured using the same method.

Reconstitution of the lumen K+ environment
In order to maintain high K+ concentration environment in the lumen of VNO slice, a local perfusion system was constructed by double barreled electrode forming solution loop as illustrated in Fig. 7a. This flow of solution confined volume smaller than 30 nl and the shape was imaged during a recording session with the fluorescein contained in the high K+ solution. With this system, we could confine the high K+ solution to the dentritic region of VNO slice without affecting the soma. The local perfusion system is connected with an ALA–VM8 to allow quick switch between solutions containing different K+ solutions, with or without urine.

Behavioral Assays
SK3T/T mice were in the C57/BL6 background. SK3−/− and TRPC2/SK3 double mutant animals were fed with 200 mg/kg doxycycline diet (BioServ) and continued after weaning. Mothers of control SK3T/T animals, the SK3T/T and TRPC2−/− mice were fed standard Lab Diet® rodent food (Picolab). GIRK1−/− were inbred with each other. Both control and experimental animals were weaned at 21 days of age, and separated into single–sex groups. Male mice were individually housed for 4–5 weeks prior to mating and aggression assays. All behavioral testing began 1 hour after commencement of the dark cycle, and was completed within 3 hours. Testing sessions were recorded using Sony TRV–88 cameras under infrared illumination and were analyzed after completion of the experiment by experienced observers blind to genotype.

Mating assay
48 hours prior to mating assays, 4–5 week old B6D2F1/J or C57Bl/6 females (Jackson laboratories) were given an injection of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) at 5 I.U. On the day of testing, a female mouse was introduced into the test male mouse’s cage and the latency, frequency and duration of mounts, intromissions and ejaculations were scored for a 30–min period.

Aggression assay
Experimental and control male mice were tested for aggression using the resident–intruder aggression assay paradigm. The 15–min assays began when a group–housed, sexually inexperienced adult male mouse (the “intruder”) of the CBA strain was introduced into an individually–housed “resident’s” cage. Parameters of aggressive behavior including latency to first attack, total attack duration, and number of bites were scored, in addition to latency to first mount, the number of mounts and mount duration.

RESULTS
Urine evokes K+ current in VNO neurons
We performed whole–cell patch clamp to record urine–evoked responses using slice preparations. In agreement with previous Ca2+ imaging experiments 25, 26, approximately 30% of the cells recorded with whole cell patch clamp showed reliable responses to repeated urine stimulation (66 out of 224 cells, 29.5%; Fig. 1a and b). The currents recorded from the soma were smaller than those recorded from dissociated cells 23. The difference might reflect the attenuation by the dendritic cable properties. Nevertheless, the picoampere currents recorded in VNO slices were physiologically relevant because they were in a range that optimally triggered spiking activities of the VNO neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1a and b; also see reference 24). Because of the relatively small size of currents, we applied a threshold of 2X baseline noise after filtering to determine whether a cell had responded to urine stimulation. Responses smaller than 0.4 pA were excluded by this criterion.

Urine application induced currents ranging from −9 pA (inward current) to +3 pA (outward current) when the cells were voltage clamped at −60 mV (Fig. 1b). Similarly diverse response profiles were also observed under current clamp. The diverse range of responses likely reflected the heterogeneous population of VNO neurons expressing different VRs and the complex composition of urine. Among the responding cells, approximately 6% of the VNO neurons showed outward currents upon urine application (Fig. 1b). In current clamp recordings, cells responded to urine stimulation with depolarization as well as hyperpolarization (Supplementary Fig. 1c and d). Cells that exhibited a hyperpolarizing response remained hyperpolarized for a duration that was significantly longer than urine application (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The cellular mechanism of the prolonged hyperpolarization was unknown.

To assess the contribution of K+ channels to urine–evoked responses, we first substituted the intracellular K+ with the impermeable Cs+. At −60 mV, current recorded with CsCl internal solution was ~54% larger than those with KCl internal solutions, suggesting that an efflux of K+ ions counteracted and reduced the inward current (Fig. 1a).

In recent studies, we and others have shown the involvement of CACCs in mediating inward currents 23, 24. In order to investigate the relationship among currents mediated by TRPC2, CACCs and the K+ channels, we substituted intracellular Cl− with non–permeable methanesulfonate (MSF−) to eliminate the contribution of Cl− conductance to urine–induced currents. In wildtype cells, the current was reduced by ~50% when recorded with MSF− intracellular solutions (Fig. 1c). In TRPC2−/− VNO neurons, average current recorded using KCl−based intracellular solution was reduced by ~35% compared to wildtype cells (Fig. 1c). The differences in current amplitude reflected the contribution of TRPC2 and CACC to VNO activation.

In TRPC2−/− neurons, TRPC2 and CACCs were not expected to contribute to urine–evoked currents when KMSF intracellular solution was used. Under this condition, strikingly, we observed an outward current in response to urine application (1.60 ± 0.24 pA; Fig. 1c). This outward current was completely abolished when intracellular K+ was replaced with impermeable Cs+ ions, suggesting that the outward current was a K+ conductance (Fig. 1c). These results indicated that in the wildtype neurons, the TRPC2 channel and the Cl− conductance carried inward current, whereas K+ currents flowed in the opposite direction reducing the overall current size. These results further suggested that the activation of the Cl− and K+ conductance was not entirely dependent on TRPC2 activation. Eliminating the contribution of Cl− conductance in TRPC2−/− neurons revealed the outward K+ conductance.

SK3 participates in urine–evoked responses
Our data suggested that K+ channels played a role in mediating urine–triggered responses in VNO. By RT–PCR analyses, we were able to detect the expression of SK3 and GIRK1 in the VNO, consistent with a recent report on the expression of various K+ channels in the VNO25. In situ hybridization showed strong signals for sk3 but far weaker signals for sk1 and sk2 transcripts (Fig. 2a). Immunofluorescent staining for SK3 showed high levels of SK3 expression in the cell bodies and the dendritic knobs (Fig. 2b) that co–localized with the TRPC2 (Fig. 2c). Unlike the TRPC2 staining, however, we also observed strong SK3 signals along the dendritic shank of the neurons.

We next examined whether the SK3 current was involved in VNO activation. Application of apamin, a potent blocker of SK channels, resulted in a ~2X increase of urine–evoked whole cell inward currents, consistent with our observation that K+ carried outward currents (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). In current clamp recordings, we observed an increased firing rate in response to urine application in the presence of apamin (Fig. 3c and d). In the subset of cells in which urine application induced hyperpolarization and a decrease in firing rate, apamin application led to depolarization and an increase in firing rate (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Additionally, only after urine application did we observe a marked slow after–hyperpolarization potential (sAHP) following a spike train induced by current injection and it was blocked by apamin (Supplementary Fig. 2b and c). The apamin–sensitive sAHP was a hallmark of the activation of SK type of K+ channels.

Our previous study demonstrated that, in the absence of TRPC2, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores could activate CACC currents 24. We investigated the IP3–mediated Ca2+ mobilization in activating the K+ current by using ruthenium red 11, 26. Ruthenium red inhibited the urine–evoked outward current in TRPC2−/− neurons recorded with KMSF intracellular solution (Fig. 2e). The ruthenium red sensitive outward current was also inhibited by apamin (Fig. 2e). Although other channels might be sensitive to ruthenium red, our results were consistent with the notion that the activation of the SK3 current could be independent of TRPC2–mediated Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ was required for activating the K+ channels.

GIRK channels participate in urine–evoked responses
In immunofluorescent staining experiments, we observed GIRK1 expression in both the cell bodies and dendrites (Fig. 3a). From the morphological features of the staining, we concluded that the GIRK channels were enriched in the VNO dendrite, with a pattern similar to that of TRPC2 expression. GIRK1 expression was also found in the dendritic shanks and not restricted to the dendritic knobs.

In pharmacological experiments, we found that two GIRK specific blockers, SCH23390 and tertiapin–Q, had similar effects in enhancing urine–activated current (Fig. 3b
Supplementary Fig. 3a and b). Current clamp recordings also showed an increase in firing rate in the presence of tertiapin–Q compared to urine alone treatment (Fig. 3c and e). Thus, GIRK1 participated in urine–evoked responses. In a separate experiment, we directly infused GTP–γ–s, a non–hydrolyzable G–protein activator, through the recording pipette. GTP–γ–s caused a profound hyperpolarization of the membrane potential (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e) and a significant decrease in the spontaneous firing rate (Supplementary Fig. 3f). This G protein–induced hyperpolarization was dependent on GIRK channels (see below).

Urine–evoked response in SK3−/− and GIRK1−/− VNOs
We next examined urine–evoked currents in the VNO neurons from mice deficient of SK3 or GIRK1 channels. We studied urine–evoked response in a mouse line (SK3T/T) in which the expression of SK3 could be inducibly silenced by doxycycline (DOX) treatment 27. In the VNO from SK3T/T mice fed with DOX, we found no detectable SK3 expression, whereas high levels of SK3 expression were found in mice fed with regular diet (Fig. 4a). In the VNO of these SK3−/− mice, apamin application no longer increased the size of current induced by urine stimulation (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4a). However, tertiapin–Q application was able to augment the response (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4b).

Because GIRK1 was shown to be obligatory for the proper function of all GIRK channels 28, 29, we examined urine–evoked currents in GIRK1−/− mutant mice 30. We confirmed the absence of GIRK1 channels in the VNO of the mutant animals with immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 4c). Analysis of urine–evoked responses of VNO neurons from GIRK1−/− mice revealed that urine–evoked current was no longer sensitive to tertiapin–Q (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4c) but was augmented by apamin (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4d). Moreover, infusion of GTP–γ–s through the patch pipette did not alter the resting potential or spontaneous spiking rate of the VNO neurons from GIRK1−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4e–h).

Single channel activities of SK3 and GIRK channels in the VNO dendrite
We next conducted single channel recording in excised patches from the VNO neuron dendrites in the slice preparations (Fig. 5a). In inside–out patches excised from wildtype VNO, elevating the intracellular Ca2+ concentration elicited single channel activities (Fig. 5b). In isotonic K+ condition, the channels had a single channel conductance of 10.08 ± 0.46 pS with no obvious rectification (Fig. 5b and c). Replacing extracellular K+ with Na+ shifted the reversal potential from ~0mV to ~ −50mV, near the reversal potential of K+ (Fig. 5c). The single channel properties of this channel type were consistent with those reported for SK331. In out–side–out patches with elevated intracellular Ca2+, the single channel activity was blocked by a brief application of apamin (Fig. 5d).

Similarly, exposing the intracellular side of the patch to purified 5 nM Gβγ subunits led to channel activities that were distinct from the action of Ca2+ (Fig. 5e). The single channel conductance under isotonic K+ condition was 15.24 ± 0.78 pS (Fig. 5f). The shift in reversal potential by replacing extracellular K+ with Na+ was similar to that of the Ca2+ –activated channels (Fig. 5f). The single channel properties of the Gβγ–activated channels were consistent with the ones reported for the small conductance GIRK channels 32. Applying Gβγ together with elevated Ca2+ led to the opening of both type of channels in the same patch (Fig. 5g).

We performed similar experiments in the SK3−/− and GIRK1−/− mice (Fig. 5h&i). In SK3−/− mice, the 10 pS activity was absent with elevated Ca2+ (5 out of 5 patches) but the 15 pS channels was activated by Gβγ (Fig. 5h). Conversely, in GIRK1−/− mice, the 10 pS channel was activated by Ca2+ but Gβγ did not activate the 15 pS channels (4 out of 4 patches; Fig. 5i). The properties of these single channels were consistent with the presence of SK3 and GIRK in the VNO dendrites.

Taken together, the data obtained from the mutant mice confirmed the participation of both SK3 and GIRK channels in urine–induced response in the dendrites of the VNO neurons. Their actions were independent of each other. Moreover, the finding of both types of single channel activities in the same patch was consistent with the coexpression of SK3 and GIRK1 channels in the same neuronal population. These observations suggested that both signaling pathways were present in the same neurons.

The paradox of urine–induced K+ current in the VNO
In order to obtain a comprehensive view of the K+ conductance in the VNO neuronal population, we performed electrovomeronasogram (EVG), extracellular field potential recording from the VNO dendritic surface. We recorded EVG signals from a total of over 55 wildtype mice and 23 mutant animals with more than 250 recordings (3–6 recordings per animal). In wildtype mice, application of urine mixtures elicited downward voltage deflections that were indicative of inward currents in the intact VNO (Fig. 6a). Based on our patch clamp results, we expected that applying apamin or tertiapin–Q would increase the size of EVG responses. Surprisingly, we found that blocking of the SK3, GIRK or both channels reduced the responses by 46.5%, 58.7% and 71.2 %, respectively (Fig. 6a).

We next examined the EVG responses in wildtype, SK3−/−, GIRK1−/− as well as TRPC2−/− mice. Consistent with the result of pharmacological blockers, the peak EVG responses to urine were reduced by approximately 21.3%, 28.2% and 49.8% in TRPC2−/−, GIRK1−/− and SK3−/− mutants, respectively (Fig. 6b). There was a 58.8% reduction in EVG responses in SK3/TRPC2 double mutants (Fig. 6b).

K+ environment in the lumen of the VNO
It was surprising that blocking K+ currents significantly diminished urine–evoked response in intact tissue. Neurons normally maintain high intracellular K+. Opening of K+ channels leads to K+ efflux and an outward current. In intact VNO, however, urine–evoked activation of the K+ channels appeared to contribute to an inward current. This observation also presented a paradox because data obtained from intact tissue (EVG) and from slice preparations (patch clamp) gave opposite conclusions. This apparent paradox could be explained if the dendrites of the VNO neurons were exposed to a local environment that was rich in K+, a situation resembling that of the cochlear hair cells, where K+ rich endolymphs led to K+ influx through the tip–link channels to depolarize the neurons. High external K+ in the VNO lumen would set the K+ reversal potential at the dendrites to a positive value to result in K+ influx through SK3 and GIRK channels. If the high K+ environment was washed away in the slice preparations, the efflux of K+ would generate outward currents.

We measured the K+ concentration in the VNO lumen using a K+–selective electrode (Fig. 7a). As control, the surface of the temporal lobe of the cortex was measured using the same method. Six independent measurements showed that K+ concentrations in the lumen of the VNO (66 ± 36 mM) were significantly greater than those observed at the cortical surfaces (17 ± 6 mM; Fig. 7b). The reversal potential in VNO dendrites was calculated to be approximately −18 mV, well above the VNO resting potential (around −50mV). Thus K+ channel activation at the dendrites would generate an inward K+ conductance to depolarize the VNO neurons.

Reconstitution of the native K+ environment
We sought to experimentally reconstitute the high K+ environment in slice preparations. Since the maintenance of high intracellular K+ and low extracellular K+ was essential to sustain the electrical gradient necessary for neuronal function, the K+ environments must be compartmentalized such that only the neuronal dendrites were exposed to high K+ in the lumen, whereas the cell bodies were in a low K+ environment. Recapitulation of the in vivo ionic environments in slice preparations therefore required the construction of compartments such that the soma and dendrites were exposed to different concentrations of K+. This was a technical challenge because the soma and dendrites were only approximately 30–100 µm apart in a slice. We devised a local perfusion system that confined solution flow in a volume smaller than 30 nl. This allowed the selective perfusion of high K+ solution to the dendrites but not to the soma (Fig. 7c). The high K+ solution, visualized by imaging of fluorescein dye, was confined to the tip of the perfusion head and could be precisely manipulated (Fig. 7d). When the local perfusion of high K+ solution was confined to the dendritic region of the VNO slice (Fig. 7d), there was little change in firing rate of the cells (Fig. 7d). By moving the tip close to the cell body, we observed a robust increase in the spontaneous firing that saturated, presumably because of the direct depolarization of the neurons (Fig. 7e). These observations indicated that we could successfully compartmentalize the K+ environment in the slice preparations. The dendritic K+ channels appeared to be inactive under normal circumstances because the cells were not excited when their dendrites were exposed to high K+ environment before urine stimulation was presented.

We examined the response of VNO neurons to urine stimulation under the reconstituted K+ environment using cell–attached extracellular recordings. By switching the dendritic K+ solution from low to high concentrations, we observed a general increase in urine–induced spiking rate. However, it was not clear whether the increase in spiking rate was the result of inverted K+ flow or from an overall depolarizing effect of K+ at the dendrites. Therefore, we sought cells that showed a decreased firing rate in response to urine stimulation (Fig. 7f). Although these cells were rare (~6% of responding cells; Fig. 1b), they provided an unambiguous demonstration of inverted flow of K+ at the dendrites. We were able to obtain three cells in this type of recordings. In one such example (Fig. 7e–g), exposure to urine under low external K+, in mACSF, resulted in a prolonged decrease in the firing rate of the cell, similar to what was observed in current clamp experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Subsequent exposure of the dendrites to a high K+ environment did not reverse the depressed firing rate (Fig. 7f). However, when urine was used to stimulate the dendrite in the high K+ solution, the neuron responded with a robust increase in firing rates (Fig. 7g). We also conducted the converse experiment by first exposing the dendrites to high K+ solution and then switching to mACSF. Urine stimulation under this configuration induced a robust increase in spiking rate that was immediately reversed when external solution at the dendrites was switched to mACSF containing diluted urine (Fig. 7h). Thus, we were able to record from individual neurons under a reconstituted lumenal environment and to demonstrate that the sign of responses were critically dependent on the K+ concentrations at the dendrites.

Aggressive and mating behaviors in SK3−/− and GIRK1−/− mutant mice
We examined innate behaviors in SK3−/− and GIRK1−/− mice. In resident–intruder aggression assays, SK3−/− mice exhibited a significant reduction in all parameters of aggressive behaviors including latency to first attack and attack frequency when compared with controls (Fig. 8a). In mating assays, we observed that sexually naïve SK3−/− males displayed a longer latency to first mount when paired with females (Fig. 8b). Similarly, GIRK1−/− mice also displayed longer latency and lower frequency in both aggression and mating assays (Fig. 8c and d).

Thus, silencing of SK3 expression resulted in abnormalities in both mating and aggressive behaviors. This observation was consistent with the notion that K+ current mediates VNO excitation. We noted that the extent of suppression of aggressive behavior in SK3−/− or GIRK−/− mice was not so profound as reported previously for TRPC2−/− males, which did not display aggressive attacks to intruder males (Fig. 8e). On the other hand, we noted that silencing SK3 or GIRK1 had a more profound effect on the sexual behaviors of the animals than TRPC2 mutants, in which male–female sexual behavior appeared normal (Fig. 8e). We wondered whether removing a K+ channel in addition to TRPC2 would exacerbate the behavioral phenotypes. We investigated the innate behaviors of SK3/TRPC2 double mutants. Consistent with the electrophysiological data, fewer double mutant animals than SK3−/− displayed aggression towards intruders and mounted females (Fig. 8e). We also noticed that the percentage of double mutant animals displaying male–to–male mounting was reduced compared with TRPC2−/− males. The reduction in the number of aggressive animals and the increase in males displaying male–to–male mounting appeared to be associated with TRPC2−/− genotype. There was not statistical significance between TRPC2−/− and SK3−/− / TRPC−/− mutants in these tests (Fig. 8e; Table S1).

DISCUSSION
The role of K+ channels in VNO signaling
Several groups have reported the participation of K+ channels in determining the electrophysiological properties of the VNO neurons. Two groups have reported that the large conductance Ca2+–activated K+ channel (BK) is responsible for outward current in VNO neuron 33, 34, which appears to set the rhythmic firing of the VNO neurons. Another study has found activity–dependent expression of ERG K+ channel, which appears to control sensory output in VNO neurons 25. Our study, on the other hand, uncovers a role of K+ channels in mediating the primary response of the VNO neurons. The action of currents mediated by GIRK and SK3 resembles the signaling mechanism of the cochlear hair cells in the acoustic organ of Corti, where high K+ in the endolymph leads to the influx of K+ ions to depolarize the cells.

Model of VNO signal transduction
Based on our results and other published studies, we propose a revised model of VNO activation. In this model, ligand recognition by a vomeronasal receptor initiates two separate intracellular pathways. The release of Gβγ subunits directly activates the GIRK channels. On the other hand, increased activity of PLC produces elevated levels of IP3 and DAG. DAG is likely to directly activate the TRPC2 channel 16, whereas IP3 can mobilize intracellular Ca2+ stores through the IP3 receptors 11, 35. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration from the stores appears sufficient to activate the SK3 and the CACCs to depolarize the cell. The influx of cations through the TRPC2 channel not only depolarizes the cell, but also contributes to the increase of intracellular Ca2+ to augment SK3 and CACC activation. We note that Ca2+–sensitive cation channels and an arachidonic acid–sensitive current have also been found in the VNOs 13, 21, 22, 36. It is possible that yet more channels participate in VNO signaling.

Our results address a puzzle in VNO signaling. The mammalian VNO expresses two main G–proteins, Gi2 and Go. Both are considered “inhibitory” as their roles have been shown to inhibit cyclase activities. The release of βγ subunits from the Gi2 and Go complex have also been shown to activate GIRK channels to cause hyperpolarization of cells. It has been enigmatic how inhibitory G–proteins contribute to VNO excitation. Our results demonstrate that the GIRK channels indeed contribute to the activation of the VNO neurons. Together with the SK3 channels, they contribute to a paradoxical influx of K+ ions that enhances the pheromone–induced depolarization.

Our observations explain the difficulties in recording from VNO slices. In VNO slices, the efflux of K+ counteracts the inward currents mediated by TRPC2 and CACCs, leading to a reduction of the overall current size. Because the current needed to depolarize VNO neurons is small, the counter flow of K+ ions makes it even harder to detect currents evoked by urine stimulation. We note that the size of current recorded in slice preparations is smaller than that from the dissociated cells. This could be explained by the intact dendritic morphology maintained in slice preparations –– the amplitude of the urine–evoked current at the dendritic knob may be attenuated by the cable properties of the dendrites. The larger currents observed in dissociated cells may also be attributed to a loss of the dendritically located K+ channels to allow larger currents to be detected.

Our observations may also reconcile the inconsistencies in VNO response to external stimulations reported by different groups. The discrepancies could be explained by experimental conditions that favored one type of current or another. In one study of dissociated neurons, Moss and colleagues have reported that urine induced an outward current from mouse VNO neurons, whereas Fadool and colleagues have reported urine–evoked currents of either polarities in different VNO neurons in turtle and lizard 37–40. These studies used KCl as the main ions in intracellular solutions, thus allowing the contribution of both K+ and Cl−. In contrast, studies that used CsCl as internal solutions reported mostly inward currents 16, 23, 24, 33. In intact tissue preparations, only an increase in the firing rate from the VNO neurons was reported, possibly as the result of retention of the intact K+ environment 41.

Independent pathways for VNO activation
TRPC2 channel has been considered as the main contributor to VNO signaling. Our model places the K+ channels and the CACCs into pheromone signaling pathways parallel to TRPC2. The currents mediated by SK3 and GIRK appear to be part of a primary response induced by urine independent on TRPC2 or CACCs; the K+ currents are activated in the absence of TRPC2 and CACC currents.

The existence of parallel pathways in VNO is in direct contrast of signal transduction in the MOE 42. In the MOE, the activation of the CACC is secondary to the CNG channels. In the VNO, TRPC2 is not indispensible for the activation of either SK3 or CACC, but it can facilitate the activation of these channels by allowing Ca2+ influx into the neuron. Ca2+ entry through TRPC2 can act synergistically with Ca2+ release from intracellular stores to activate SK3 and CACC. These observations are consistent with previous studies suggesting TRPC2–independent activation of the VNO 13, 36.

Innate behaviors of SK3−/−, GIRK1−/− and TRPC2−/− mice
Deficits in mating and aggression behaviors are observed in SK3−/− mice and GIRK1−/− mice, further supporting an important role of the K+ channels in VNO function. However, there are important discrepancies in mating and aggressive behaviors between SK3−/−, GIRK1−/− and TRPC2−/− mice. Mating with females is affected in SK3−/− and GIRK1−/−, but not in TRPC2−/− mice. On the other hand, the extent of the suppression of aggression in SK3−/− or GIRK1−/− mice is not as profound as observed in TRPC2 mutant males 18–20. It is important to note that the knockout of the SK3 and GIRK1 channel is not restricted to the VNO, nor is TRPC2. Silencing of these genes in brain regions other than the VNO may contribute to the observed deficits in mating and aggression. Alternatively, it is possible that distinct populations of neurons reside within the VNO and the relative contribution of TPRC2, SK3 and GIRK1 differs in different cells.

Noticeably male–male mounting is observed with far greater frequency in TRPC2 mutants than in wild type mice and is not observed in SK3−/−, GIRK1−/− mice or in mice with VNO surgically removed. The frequency is also reduced in TRPC2/SK3 double mutants. It is also worth noting that in mice missing Gi2 or Go proteins, no male–to–male mounting behaviors were observed 43, 44. Thus, the male–male mounting is likely specific to TRPC2−/− mice. A plausible explanation of this phenotype in the TRPC2−/− mice is the selective loss of the basal layer of VNO neurons. In TRPC2−/−, more than 50% of the basal layer of neurons, which express the V2R family of vomeronasal receptors and the Go protein, are lost (Fig. S5) 18. The apical layer, which expresses the V1Rs, appears relatively intact. TRPC2−/− mice also display differential hypotrophy of the glomerular layer of the AOB, with the anterior portion (the Gi2 zone) intact but the posterior portion (Go zone) reduced or absent 45. Consistent with these results, recording from the basal layer of neurons using multielectrode showed a dramatic decrease in urine–evoked responses 18, whereas sampling of the whole population with EVG recordings, or recording from dissociated cells, revealed residual responses 19, 36, 46. It is therefore possible that the contribution by the V2R expressing neurons is more severely affected than the apical cells in TRPC2−/− mice. The differential effects on the two anatomically segregated neuronal populations may create an imbalance of pheromone signaling to the brain. This imbalance, together with reduced activation of the remaining cells, may lead to the male–male mounting phenotypes observed in the TRPC2−/− mice. SK3−/− and GIRK1−/− mice does not appear to have the selective loss of neurons.

Sensitivity and robustness of urine–evoked responses
The VNO is highly sensitive to pheromones 47, 48. This sensitivity is the result of specific interaction between the ligand and the receptor, the amplification of signals transduced by receptor occupancy, and the sensitivity in generating membrane currents. VNO neurons maintain depolarized membrane potentials at rest along with high input resistance 11, 38, 49. As we and others have shown, the neurons are exquisitely sensitive to small currents 24, 49. The depolarized resting potential allows the neurons to rest close to the detection threshold while the high input resistance allows excitation by small electrical input, which significantly enhances the sensitivity of VNO neurons in response to pheromone stimuli.

The high level of sensitivity to small currents may allow the contributions of several ion species to activate the VNO and enables the VNO to accommodate to different external ionic environments. Pheromones are contained in saliva, body and gland secretions, as well as fecal and urinary excretions. These sources are high in salt content. The VNO, therefore, must be able to cope with the variation of salt concentrations. By permitting most common ions (Na+, K+ and Cl−) to contribute to the depolarization of the neurons, the VNO response is less influenced by changes in the environment. Hence, the VNO is one of several sensory systems that have evolved specialized transduction mechanisms that exploit unique ionic environments to enhance signal transduction and to accommodate their distinct functional requirements.

Most HIV-infected individuals are coinfected by Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 reactivates more frequently in HIV-coinfected individuals with advanced immunosuppression, and may have very unusual clinical presentations, including hypertrophic genital lesions. We report the case of a progressive, hypertrophic HSV-2 lesion in an HIV-coinfected woman, despite near-complete immune restoration on antiretroviral therapy for up to three years. In this case, there was prompt response to topical imiquimod. The immunopathogenesis and clinical presentation of HSV-2 disease in HIV-coinfected individuals are reviewed, with a focus on potential mechanisms for persistent disease despite apparent immune reconstitution. HIV-infected individuals and their care providers should be aware that HSV-2 may cause atypical disease even in the context of near-comlpete immune reconstitution on HAART.

1. INTRODUCTION
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of the most
prevalent sexually transmitted infections worldwide [1]. HSV-2 is extremely
common in countries where HIV is endemic, and coinfects over 75% of
HIV-infected individuals living in or originating from these countries, but the
HSV-2 seroprevalence is also over 50% in HIV-infected individuals from the
developed world [2, 3]. Atypical or
unusual manifestations of genital herpes are not uncommon in HIV-coinfected
individuals, and persistent anogenital lesions due to HSV-2 were among the
first opportunistic infections described in those with the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [4]. Opportunistic infections may transiently
worsen during the period of immune reconstitution following the initiation of
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a phenomenon known as immune
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), with HSV-2 reactivation accounting
for up to half of IRIS cases [5]. However, the median time from initiating
HAART to developing IRIS is three months, and IRIS is rare once stable immune
reconstitution has been achieved [5]. Antiviral-resistant
HSV is uncommon, although more frequently encountered among immunocompromised
individuals compared to immunocompetent persons [6].

Hypertrophic anogenital lesions are a rare complication of
HSV-2 in HIV-coinfected men and women [7–10], generally occurring in the
context of significant immune deficiency or during IRIS [11], and these lesions
may be very difficult to diagnose and treat. We present the case of a 35
year-old, HIV-infected woman with a recalcitrant hypertrophic vulvar lesion due
to HSV-2. The development and prolonged persistence of this lesion after
near-complete immune reconstitution on HAART implies that there are significant
residual defects in host HSV-2 immune control, and that these may have
important clinical implications for patients and their care providers.

2. CASE REPORT
The patient was a 34-year old,
asymptomatic Zimbabwe-born woman with a positive HIV IgG ELISA on immigration
screening in 2002. There was no prior history of sexually transmitted
infections, genital or perianal ulceration, and syphilis serology was negative.
Her absolute CD4+ T cell count at diagnosis was 156/mm3, with an
HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load of more than 100 000 copies/mL. Antiretroviral
therapy was initiated one month later, in October 2002, with combivir one
tablet twice daily and nevirapine 200 mg twice daily, together with
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as primary prophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia. By January 2003,
her CD4+ T cell count had increased to almost 500/mm3, and her HIV
viral load remained persistently undetectable after March 2003, at which point
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was discontinued. In April 2003, she noted
multiple painful papules on the left labia, with subsequent superficial
ulceration. She had no reported sexual contacts for over a year. Her family
physician prescribed empiric therapy with acyclovir 400 mg three times daily
and keflex 500 mg three times daily, followed by oral valacyclovir 500 mg twice
daily.

In July 2003, nine months after starting
HAART, the shallow ulcerations had resolved but a pruritic 1 × 3 cm granulomatous
lesion developed on the left labia. This was associated with surrounding tissue
edema, and shotty left inguinal lymphadenopathy, and progressed over the
subsequent two months (Figure 1(a)). There was no response to azithromycin
1 gram weekly for 4 weeks, as empiric therapy for granuloma inguinale. Both a
superficial swab and a punch biopsy of the hypertrophic lesion demonstrated
HSV-2, with glassy nuclear chromatin, multinucleation and surrounding severe
acute and chronic inflammation (Figure 1(b)). Topical therapy was initiated with
trifluridine, together with oral valacyclovir 1 gram twice daily. There was no
clinical response, although valacyclovir discontinuation was followed by an
outbreak of painful, scattered shallow ulcerations that were culture positive
for HSV-2. From November 2003 and December 2005 she was treated with 4 one-month
courses of intravenous foscarnet; despite a near total clinical response to the
first course, the response waned progressively and the fourth course was
complicated by Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis
at the line site. Lesion cultures were repeatedly positive for HSV-2, and a
repeat labial biopsy in February 2006 showed only chronic granulation tissue.
There was no response to a trial of topical protopic (tacrolimus) in August
2006.

In September 2006 there was a prompt
clinical response to topical imiquimod 5%, applied 3 times weekly, with
resolution of the lesion within eight weeks. She remains asymptomatic on
oral valacyclovir 1 gram twice daily combined with topical imiquimod 5% as
needed (approximately one topical application every two weeks) with minor
residual labial scarring.

3. DISCUSSION
We have presented a case of an African
female patient with recalcitrant hypertrophic genital HSV-2, which was
clinically resistant to standard antiviral therapy and to intravenous
foscarnet, but which responded promptly to topical 5% imiquimod. An initial
“typical” genital herpes outbreak occurred in the context of rapid immune
recovery, and was quite compatible with IRIS, as has been described in Ugandan
men starting therapy [11]. However,
while this outbreak responded to standard herpes therapy, the hypertrophic
genital HSV-2 lesion developed and persisted despite near-complete immune
recovery for up to three years. The rapid clinical response that was seen to
topical imiquimod, an agonist of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) that boosts both
host innate and adaptive antiviral immunity [12], strongly implies that there
were clinically significant defects in host antiherpes immunity despite
HAART-induced immune recovery.

Hypertrophic or squamoproliferative
anogenital lesions in HIV-positive individuals or those with AIDS are uncommon
and can pose a diagnostic dilemma. The
most likely cause of such lesions is either neoplasia or infection, although
the differential diagnosis can be wide [13]. 
It may be difficult to determine the cause of a lesion based on
appearance alone, and the sensitivity of various diagnostic tests can be
affected by the reactive changes present in these lesions [10]. Further, small biopsies may be inconclusive
or provide misleading information [8]. 
It may be necessary to employ repeat biopsies and viral cultures in
cases suspicious for HSV. In our
patient, the first biopsy of the lesion in 2003 was positive for HSV-2, but a
second biopsy performed after the lesion had recurred in 2006 was negative for
HSV-1, HSV-2, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and spirochetes using immunohistochemical
special stains, showing only chronic granulation tissue present. This reinforces that it may be difficult to
demonstrate virus even in a generous biopsy specimen, especially in the
presence of chronic, extensive granulation tissue. Because this second biopsy was negative for
HSV, it is possible that
HSV reactivation occurred within this
proliferative mass, rather than causing it.
However, it is more likely that HSV was in fact the etiologic agent
responsible for the progression.

The pathogenesis of proliferative
and hypertrophic HSV lesions in the immunocompromised patient population is
poorly understood. It is thought to be a
reflection of the increased duration of the disease course rather than any
inherent change in the pathogenicity of the HSV-2 itself [14]. Early reports hypothesized that immune
dysfunction secondary to HIV, perhaps mediated by T-helper type 2 cytokines,
might result in the epidermal hyperplasia [15]. 
Whatever the etiology of these lesions, their presence has been linked
to immune function. In HIV-infected
individuals, HSV-2 infection is associated with an increased number and size of
genital lesions relative to immunocompetent individuals [16]. Vesicles and ulcers are typically more
necrotic, painful, and heal more slowly [17]. 
Finally, as CD4 cell count drops and immune status worsens, recurrent
outbreaks increase in frequency and severity [18].

Underlying the increased severity of
HSV-2 disease in HIV-coinfected patients are defects in herpes-specific
immunity. In a recent report of herpes simplex vegetans in an HIV-infected
individual with severe CD4+ T cell depletion [19], a specific defect was
demonstrated in the production of type I interferons by plasmacytoid dendritic
cells in response to HSV. Dendritic cells within the epithelium of the genital
tract itself are important in mediating protective immunity against HSV [20],
but these cells are dramatically depleted in the genital mucosa of HIV-infected
individuals [21]. Finally, HIV infection
may be associated with impaired HSV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses, although
these defects improve progressively after starting HAART [22]. In contrast, our patient had a normal CD4
count, an undetectable viral load, and had been on HAART for six months prior
to the development of her lesions. The pathogenesis of progressive hypertrophic
HSV-2 in this context, where such immune defects would be expected to
have improved substantially, is not clear, although a similar case has been
reported of a rapidly growing and recurrent genital mass in an HIV-infected
woman on HAART with a CD4 T cell count >500/mm3 [7].

Immunocompromised individuals are more
likely to be infected with HSV-2 that is resistant to antiviral medications 
[6]. Resistance to acyclovir is usually associated with resistance to the other
nucleoside analog drugs, including famciclovir and valacyclovir [9]. In such
cases, foscarnet or topical cidofovir may be useful, since they have different
mechanisms of action [23]. Unfortunately, antiviral resistance testing was not
available for our patient, although the prompt response of her “classical”
ulcerative genital herpes outbreak to both acyclovir and valacyclovir, with
rapid recurrence when suppressive treatment was stopped, suggested drug
sensitivity. However, the hypertrophic lesion was clinically resistant to
multiple courses of famciclovir and valacyclovir, as well as to later courses
of intravenous foscarnet. Ultimately, there was a rapid and complete response
to topical 5% imiquimod cream. Others have reported varied success with the use
of imiquimod for HSV-2 therapy [19, 24], and this drug should be considered in
the armamentarium for resistant and recurrent genital HSV-2 in HIV-infected
individuals. Thalidomide has also been described as useful in HIV-positive
patients with hypertrophic lesions, although this drug was not used in our case 
[25].

While uncommon, hypertrophic or
squamoproliferative HSV disease in the HIV-positive population can be a very
challenging clinical condition. It is painful, disfiguring, and difficult to
diagnose and treat. As demonstrated by our patient, it can be seen in
individuals anywhere along the spectrum of immune dysfunction. If clinically
suspected, repeated attempts at diagnosis with viral cultures and biopsies are
warranted. These lesions are often resistant to first-line antiviral treatment,
and may require less commonly used therapies such as foscarnet, cidofovir,
imiquimod, or thalidomide. In our case, imiquimod eventually resulted in a good
clinical outcome.

Angola is one of the African countries with the highest morbidity and mortality rates and a devastating lack of human resources for health, including nursing. The World Health Organization stimulates and takes technical cooperation initiatives for human resource education and training in health and education, with a view to the development of countries in the region. The aim in this study was to identify how nurses affiliated with nursing education institutions perceive the challenges nursing education is facing in Angola.

Methods
After consulting the National Directory of Human Resources in Angola, the nurse leaders affiliated with professional nursing education institutions in Angola were invited to participate in the study by email. Data were collected in February 2009 through the focus group technique. The group of participants was focused on the central question: what are the challenges faced for nursing education in your country? To register and understand the information, besides the use of a recorder, the reporters elaborated an interpretative report. Data were coded using content analysis.

Results
Fourteen nurses participated in the meeting, most of whom were affiliated with technical nursing education institutions. It was verified that the nurse leaders at technical and higher nursing education institutions in Angola face many challenges, mainly related to the lack of infrastructure, absence of trained human resources, bureaucratic problems to regularize the schools and lack of material resources. On the opposite, the solutions they present are predominantly centered on the valuation of nursing professionals, which implies cultural and attitude changes.

Conclusions
Public health education policies need to be established in Angola, including action guidelines that permit effective nursing activities. Professional education institutions need further regularizations and nurses need to be acknowledged as key elements for the qualitative enhancement of health services in the country.

Abstract
Introdução
Angola é um dos países africanos que apresenta os maiores índices de morbimortalidade e devastadora insuficiência de recursos humanos na área de saúde, incluindo a enfermagem. A Organização Mundial da Saúde estimula e implementa iniciativas de cooperação técnica para a formação e aperfeiçoamento de recursos humanos na área da saúde e educação, visando o desenvolvimento dos países africanos. Este estudo teve como objetivo identificar as percepções dos enfermeiros vinculados a Escolas de Formação em Enfermagem em relação aos desafios para o ensino de enfermagem em Angola.

Metodologia
Após consulta ao Diretório Nacional de Recursos Humanos de Angola os líderes em enfermagem vinculados a Escolas de Formação em Enfermagem do país foram convidados a participar do estudo por meio de convites eletrônicos. Para a coleta de dados, realizada no mês de fevereiro de 2009, foi utilizada a técnica de Grupo Focal. O grupo de participantes foi direcionado para a questão central: quais os desafios encontrados para a educação em enfermagem no seu país? Para o registro e compreensão das informações, além do uso de um gravador, um relatório interpretativo foi elaborado pelos relatores. Os dados foram codificados via análise de conteúdo.

Resultados
Participaram do encontro 14 enfermeiros, sendo a maioria vinculada a escolas de ensino de enfermagem de nível técnico. Verificou-se que os líderes de Escolas de Nível Técnico e Superior de Enfermagem em Angola enfrentam muitos desafios, relacionados principalmente à falta de infra-estrutura, ausência de recursos humanos capacitados, problemas com a burocracia para a regularização das escolas e escassez de recursos materiais. Em contrapartida, apresentam soluções centradas predominantemente na valorização dos profissionais de enfermagem, o que implica em mudanças culturais e de atitude.

Conclusões
É necessário o estabelecimento de políticas públicas de educação em saúde em Angola com diretrizes de ação que permitam a atuação efetiva dos enfermeiros. Salienta-se a necessidade de regularização das Escolas profissionalizantes e o reconhecimento do enfermeiro como elemento chave para o incremento da qualidade dos serviços de saúde do país.

Background
The mission of the World Health Organization [1] is health promotion, focusing its guidelines on strategic regions, including the African continent, which is characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates and a low human development index (HDI). Angola, a Portuguese-speaking African country, was devastated by a long-lasting civil war, resulting in a low HDI, which has ranked the country in the 148th position on the list of countries included in the Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Program [2].

One of the causes of the high morbidity and mortality rates is the lack of human resources. According to the Global Health Workforce Alliance [3], in 57 countries around the world, less than 23 health workers are available for every 10000 people. As a result, maternal and child mortality ratios in all of these countries surpass those measured in developed countries, even reaching extremely alarming levels. Angola is part of this group, with one physician and 63 nursing professionals for every 10000 inhabitants and 220 deaths of children before the age of five for every 1000 live births.

With a view to promoting development in African countries, WHO and other international non-governmental organizations stimulate and take technical cooperation initiatives in health and education, valuing human resource education and training [1,4]. The Task Force on Health Systems Research mentioned human resources for health as a priority to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) [5]. In addition, according to the Millennium Development Goals Report [6], the global achievement of the MDGs will only be possible through cooperation, strengthening of partnerships between national and international authorities and political commitment to nations. It is fundamental for those in power to prioritize the interventions that are most influential or capable of exerting a cascade effect on a wide range of indicators. The intrinsic connection among gender empowerment, education, poverty and health is well known. These and other relations need to be further explored with a view to sharpening the intervention’s strategic focus, aiming for the development of countries devastated by misery.

In 2010, Brazil and Angola formalized their interest in reinforcing their exchange relations in the fields of technical-scientific knowledge, defenceand human resource education. In the Joint Declaration for a Strategic Partnership, several bilateral agreements were closed, including Technical, Scientific and Technological Cooperation, which comprises the strengthening of qualified human resource development and joint bilateral research promotion, in areas like health, education and higher and postgraduate teacher training [7]. The common language is a facilitator to broaden the relations between both countries and favours the expansion of cooperation agreements in professional education and training for nursing teaching and care delivery.

Among the 45 WHO Collaborating Centres for Nursing and Midwifery Development, only one is hosted in a Portuguese-speaking country,Brazil, represented in this global support network by the University of São Paulo at RibeirãoPreto College of Nursing. Since 1988, the college has served as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Nursing Research Development. Therefore, the institution has occupied the forefront in movements and programmes to respond to nursing human resource needs in Portuguese-speaking African countries(PALOP).

The aim in this study was to identify how nurses affiliated with nursing education institutions perceive the challenges nursing education is facing in Angola. Knowing the opinion of nurse leaders in Angola about relevant elements for nursing education is important because they are directly involved in decision-making processes involving nursing teaching and care practice in that country. They are responsible for discussing changes with all stakeholders involved, as well as for assessing the circumstances, values and risks of each alternative and for identifying the needs and consequences of each action, with a view to facilitating teaching and promoting the growth and recognition of Angolan nursing.

Methods
In this qualitative study, the focus group technique was applied to collect the data. This technique is characterized by the discussion of different aspects related to the same theme, permitting a more in-depth analysis of problems, based on the participants’ perceptions, feelings and emotions [8,9].

After consulting the National Directory of Human Resources in Angola, the nurse leaders,who are professionals affiliated with professional nursing education institutions in the country, were identified. Then, directors of technical and higher education institutions were invited by email to participate in a meeting. The invitations contained superficial information about the research theme, to avoid them from bringing any prejudiced ideas on the theme to the meeting. The main limitation to their participation was their non-availability to take part in the focus group on the established date and time.

The focus group dynamics took place in February 2009, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., in the auditorium of a higher education institution located in the province of Luanda. The meeting consisted of the following phases: organization of the room to hold the dynamics, welcoming of the participants, explanations about the technique, reading and signing of the informed consent form, presentation of the participants, start of the guiding questions, and synthesis of the main themes addressed.

The researchers were divided into the roles of coordinator, moderator and reporter and the participants were informed about each person’s role. A time was preset for the activities to end.After the participants had presented themselves, the group was oriented towards the central question: what are the challenges faced with regard to nursing education in your country?

To register and understand the information, the reporters used a recorder and elaborated an interpretative report. The testimonies were subject to exhaustive reading, followed by the organization and categorization of the data by highlighting recurring themes or patterns. The analysis categories led to the following descriptive themes: challenges for nursing education and solutions to overcome the challenges.

At the end, the data were interpreted, emphasizing the numerical description of how certain explanatory categories figured in the discussions [10]. Under the flexible guidance of the moderator, who guaranteed that the participants continued focusing on the theme, a number of challenges and solutions were proposed.

This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee at the University of São Paulo at RibeirãoPreto College of Nursing. Respect for the participants’ dignity and autonomy were guaranteed. Their identities were preserved and their privacy was respected in all research phases, recognizing their vulnerability and free will. They were guaranteed the freedom to cease their participation at any time, without any kind of penalty if they refused to participate or decided to drop out of the study. The research collaborators complied with the ethical determinations of Resolution 196/96 by the Brazilian National Health Council, regarding the authorization to record the participants’ discourse and the signing of an informed consent form, and also signed a group contract to guarantee shared ethical secrecy and facilitate the interaction process. The participants were informed that recording their statements was necessary to guarantee the reliable transmission of the contents, but that these recordings would solely be used for research purposes and destroyed at the end of the study. In order to preserve the participants’ identity and anonymity, capital letters were used in the transcriptions to identify them.

The institutions of origin were asked to provide logistic support and grant permission for the nurses’ participation; the researchers funded two days of accommodation for each participant at the data collection site.

Results
Fourteen nurses participated in the meeting, eight of whom were affiliated with technical schools, four with higher education institutions and two with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Angola. The participants came from five provinces, including the capital Luanda. Two nurses indicated they were unable to participate in the study, due to professional commitments that prevented them from travelling to the place of data collection on the date set for the activity. The majority (64.3%) of nurses were between 51 and 55 years of age, with ten (71.4%) male and four (28.6%) female participants.In Table 1, the participants’ profile of professional education, function and experience in the job is displayed.Among the participants, the nine nurses who were active in teaching accumulated other roles also listed in Table 1.

The participants mentioned the insufficient number of places to respond to the demand for secondary and higher nursing courses. One of the causes for this lack of places is related to the displacement of nursing schools to make room for medical schools. In addition, most educational and training institutions are located in the capital, while few schools are located in the provinces, making it difficult for most potential students to have access.

Among the financial issues that further enhance these difficulties, payment requirements to use training areas in private institutions were mentioned, equivalent to 20 dollars per student/day. Furthermore, professionals from these services demand payment to monitor the students in the field.

For a number of reasons, the Republic of Angola counts on expertise established in other countries to prepare and train qualified professionals, but one of the factors attributed to the lack of human resources relates to the trend for Angolan students to remain in the countries where they received their education, with low rates of return after graduation. In addition, the skills gained abroad do not always correspond to the local reality and needs.

The insufficient number of nurses with teacher training leads to the use of non-qualified staff to supervise practical activities in clinical training areas. The participants reported that most professionals active in this sphere only hold a primary education degree. Special training programmes in nursing are unable to function on a regular basis, due to a lack of trained teaching staff, which exacerbates the lack of places even further.

Among the challenges mentioned, work conditions in public institutions were highlighted, which as opposed to the private sector, do not favor good professional performance. Thus, some professionals migrate to private services, in search of more appropriate work conditions to perform their functions.

The matter that the group felt most strongly about was the need to regulate the Technical and Vocational Schools in Health (ETPS). The participants reported that the Secondary Education Institutions in Health (IMES) have always offered inappropriate training to technical professionals, but that proposals have been formulated to transform the IMES into ETPS; no political support has been found for this initiative though.

Another aspect addressed was the teaching focus, which privileges tertiary care, in the IMES as well as in Higher Education Institutions (HEI), which does not correspond to or only partially attends to market and community needs. The insufficient number of hospital institutions with human and material resources at their disposal further aggravates this difficulty, mainly at Intensive Care Units and Operating Rooms.

A curriculum revision is due at the secondary and higher education levels, in view of the inappropriate similarity between both programmes. In the same sense, another source of concern is the focusof the undergraduate course curriculumon preparing students for professional activities in the third year of their programme, while only graduating as a registered nurse at the end of the fourth year.The participants consider that the lack of sensitivity about nursing human resource training in Angola among those in power, across all activity spheres, further aggravates this situation.In Table 3, the solutions the group proposed are displayed, related to the challenges mentioned.

Discussion
The challenges addressed are not exclusive to the nursing area. A study developed in 20 countries, including Angola, emphasizes the lack of health professionals to respond to the population needs [11], which demonstrates the importance of education and the continuous development of these resources. In another recent study, involving medical students enrolled in public schools in Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique, which was aimed at describing and analyzing expectations about the profession and the difficulties related to education and the professional future, it was identified that investments in the infrastructure and preparation of higher education institutions are fundamental to achieve institutional success.

Particular attention needs to be devoted to students’ socialization and teachers’ roles and status. In countries with a lack of resources, a focus on the hospital area is noticeable, instead of being associated to skills development for work in primary care areas. The development of local graduate programs can serve as an interesting strategy to support the retention of professionals in their country of origin [12].

As regards the valuation of nurses, an incipient political movement seems to be on course to acknowledge nursing as an important part of health services. In a speech on the occasion of the Day of the Nurse, celebrated in May 2012, the Minister of Health of Angola, Mr José Van-Dúnem, recalled that nurses are responsible for controlling and guaranteeing therapy and for transmitting moral and psychological support to patients and their families. He added that nursing can get closer to the community and enhance the effective execution of municipal health programs, so as to reduce the demand referral hospitals are confronted with and return the population’s confidence in health professionals. According to an article published in Jornal de Angola, another aspect the minister highlighted was the improved efficiency and quality of health services and the valuing of human beings [13].

In 2012, the Angolan Nursing Council chose the theme "Fighting inequality: from evidence to action”. According to the Minister of Health, the theme follows the executive power’s concern with making efforts to improve work conditions and serve as motivation for nursing professionals to continue working with their characteristic zeal and dedication [13].

The proposal disseminated by the Angolan Nursing Council, as presented in the Activity Plan and Budget for 2011, underlines concerns with nursing education, in accordance with the participants’ reports. In the document, the need to strengthen the qualified interventions of educational policiesis highlighted, including proactive participation in the redesign of organized responses to the learning needs. As fundamental pillars for the autonomic and developmental process of the profession, education and research continue to be in need of further professional and political deepening [14].

In other African countries, difficulties for nursing education are similar. In Kenya, the problematic situation of higher education, mainly related to the characteristics of the education system in force and the lack of public support, does not favour educational opportunities after gaining a basic degree. The country’s experience has shown that distance education is effective and can support professional nursing training at different levels, including leadership in clinical practice, teaching, administration and research [15].

South Africa’s experience shows a legacy of inequalities in health care access, growing morbidity and mortality rates and an insufficient number of qualified nurses to achieve the MDGs the government defined in 2010. According to researchers, nurse managers need to influence political decisions that involve nursing services and the education needed to prepare the next generation of professionals to execute these new services [16].

In Ghana, to solve problems related to health service delivery and the lack of nursing professionals, the participation of all stakeholders was required, moving beyond traditional stereotypes, showing flexibility and orientation towards the future. Political options included the expansion of nursing education, broadening of teaching locations, offering of professional training, and collaborative education opportunities, which improved personal satisfaction rates and professionals’ continuation in their country. The international exchange of nurses and resources was shown to be mutually beneficial for the countries of origin and the collaborators [17].

The convergence between nursing education difficulties in Angola and other African countries, as well as the solutions proposed to minimize the problems raised, show the urgent need to elaborate and put in practice strategies to improve the quality of education and professional teaching and practice conditions in nursing, leading to the acknowledgement of the role of nursingin the context of the health-disease and teaching-learning process, among others. The Brazilian researchers discussed the fact that all issues addressed demand paradigm changes in professional education, with a view to the collective construction of a more active and committed nursing workforce, which participates in decision-making on public, social and institutional policies. The same discussion and approach can be directed at African countries such as Angola [18].

The Ouagadougou Declaration on primary health care and health systems in Africa,Achieving Better Health for Africa in the New Millennium, provides a framework for implementing necessary activities in each of the WHO priority programme areas. The Declaration proposes recommendations for consideration by Member States in the development of their own country frameworks. All 46 Member States have national health sector development policies and plans, which provide a platform for the national health agenda. A number of countries have developed HRH policies and plans [19].

The predominance of male participants stands out in the sample. Angola has a 27-year history of civil war, which started in 1975, caused by a global identity crisis that was associated with exogenous factors. The conflict originated countless internal and external migration movements. A mass migration movement was observedin search of new existential possibilities, particularly among the male population in response to fears of combat and the consequences of civil war [20]. The literature about the theme is scarce, but the participants’ reports revealed that most men who emigrated looked for educational opportunities in other countries, assuming the commitment to return home with better social, cultural and financial development conditions for their families and compatriots. This can justify the predominance of male participants in the population of nurse leaders.

To date, many African health professionals have migrated to developed nations to promote their education and career, leading to a lack of health professionals in their countries of origin. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that 18% of all physicians and 11% of all nurses who work in their countries are foreigners. This migration aggravates the lack of health professionals and contributes towards the weakening of poor nations’ health systems, which have failed in their attempts to manage the severe health problems that affect the population [21].

According to Mateus Foster, the director of international issues of the Royal College of Physicians in London, the reasons for this migration go beyond the very small remuneration and involve the work and living conditions, education and, at the bottom, continuous professional development [21].

Nursing in Angola has reached a moment to conquer its professional space. Therefore, it is fundamental to establish regulatory policies, defining the rights and duties of all categories involved, to determine and legitimize nurses’ function in the health team, including respect for and acknowledgement of their role in the community [22].

The African Region continues to focus on standardizing guidelines and curricula and is actively implementing competence-based training for nurses and midwives, from pre-service through to faculty education levels. Despite challenges, progress is being made. Some countries are actively implementing the strategies to enhance institutional capacity and the education of suitably skilled practitioners. Scaling up the strengthening of nursing and midwifery education is accelerating in all six WHO. Curriculum evaluations for pre-service nursing and midwifery education programmes have been conducted in West and East African countries. Challenges identified include: curricula that are not competence-based; unclear distinctions between nursing and midwifery especially in francophone countries; shortage of teachers; and inadequate training and teaching materials and infrastructure [19].

In addition to the fact that not all leaders contacted were able to attend, another study limitation is that it cannot be guaranteed that the participants demonstrated their complete potential to contribute to the discussion fulltime. Also, as the data collection was formally organized and involved acquaintances, there may have been concerns about what should or should not be said. When analyzing the results, it would be interesting to combine the data with other information obtained through different data collection techniques, which goes beyond the present research objectives [23].

Also, the statistical database available about Angola is relatively outdated and very fragile. Despite the pertinence of the sources used, it is important to indicate some limitations in the data, due to the lack of studies and published material about the theme.

Conclusion
The results of this study have demonstrated that technical and vocational schools in nursing in Angola face many challenges, related to the lack of infrastructure, absence of trained human resources especially in the public sector, bureaucratic problems to regularize schools and lack of material resources.

On the other hand, the solutions they present are predominantly focused on the valuing of nursing professionals, which implies cultural and attitudinal changes. In that sense, public health education policies in Angola should establish action guidelines that permit nurses’ effective activities, including the regularization of vocational schools and based on the recognition of nurses as key elements to enhance the quality of health services in that country.

Several models of integrated service delivery (ISD) networks are presently experimented in Canada and elsewhere, but most of them are designed according to a full integration model (PACE, S-HMO, SIPA). PRISMA is the only example of a coordinated-type model to be developed and fully implemented with a process and outcome evaluation.

The PRISMA model includes the following components to enhance the integration: 1) co-operation between decision-makers and managers of all services and institutions, 2) the use of a single entry point, 3) case management process, 4) individualized service plans, 5) a unique disability-based assessment tool (SMAF) with a case-mix system (Iso-SMAF profiles) and case-finding tool (PRISMA-7), and 6) a computerized system for communicating between institutions and professionals.

The PRISMA model
The PRISMA model was implemented in three areas (urban, rural with or without a local hospital) in Québec, Canada and research was carried out using both qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate its process and impact. An efficiency study was carried out, considering societal costs and all population impacts.

Based on the population impact demonstration, the PRISMA model has also been adapted and implemented in France. This symposium will present the implementation, impact and efficiency of the Québec experimentation, and the implementation transfer in France.

The 4 abstracts related to this project presentation: 
1. Description and implementation of the PRISMA ISD system in Québec
Hébert R, Veil A, Raîche M, Dubois M-F, Dubuc N, Tousignant M

Components: The six components of the PRISMA model will be presented. The model was implemented in three areas (urban, rural with or without a local hospital) in Québec, Canada and the implementation evaluation was carried out using mixed (qualitative and quantitative) methods. Over four years, the implementation rates went from 22% to 79%. The perception of integration by managers and clinicians working in the different organizations of the network shows that most interactions are perceived at the cooperation level and some getting to the highest collaboration level. The perception of efficacy of case managers was very high. Implementing such model is feasible and decision to generalize it was made in Québec.

2. Population impact of PRISMA on frail older people and utilization of health and social services
Hébert R, Raîche M, Dubois M-F, Gueye NR, Dubuc N, Tousignant M

Objective: The objective of the population impact study was to evaluate the impact of the PRISMA model on health, satisfaction and services utilization of frail older people. It was a population-based study with a quasi-experimental design. From a random selection of people over 75 years old, a sample of 1501 persons identified at risk of functional decline was recruited in the three experimental areas (n=751) and three comparison zones (n=800). Subjects were measured at baseline and yearly for four years on functional autonomy, satisfaction with services and empowerment. Functional decline was defined as a loss of five points on the SMAF disability scale, institutionalization or death. Information on utilization of health and social services (public, private and community) was collected by bi-monthly phone questionnaires.

Results: When the last two years (where implementation rate was over 75%) were compared with first two years, the experimental group presented a difference of 6.3% on functional decline prevalence (p=0.03). Satisfaction and empowerment were significantly higher (both p<0.001) in the experimental group. For health services utilization, a 20% reduction of visits to emergency room (p<0.001) was observed in the experimental cohort. The hospitalization rate was also lower in the experimental group but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.19). No significant effect was observed on other services.

3. Efficiency of the PRISMA model regarding population impacts
Durand S, Hébert R, Blanchette D, Buteau M

Efficiency: Assessing the efficiency of PRISMA is based on a comprehensive economic evaluation, with a societal approach. Given the implementation complexity of the six components in this innovative integration model, a micro-analysis was performed to assess its implementation and operational costs for the three experimental areas. The impact on residential, health and social services expenditures was also valued, based on use data collected during bimonthly interviews. Unit costs of these numerous services were estimated according to the opportunity cost approach. All these economic data were compared with the results of the population impact study through a cost-consequences analysis in order to measure PRISMA efficiency.

Results: The overall cost was not higher in the experimental group. It seems that implementation and operational costs of the PRISMA were offset relatively quickly by the savings likely stemming from better-adapted services. Also, the PRISMA had no effect on the mix of public, private and community costs. The population impact study showed positive impacts on functional decline prevalence, on handicaps, and on older people's satisfaction and empowerment. The only negative impact on the population is caregiver burden. Overall, these findings add evidence in support of increased efficiency under PRISMA.

A series of cadmium xanthate complexes is synthesized for use as in situ precursors to cadmium sulfide nanoparticles in hybrid P3HT/CdS solar cells. The formation of CdS domains is studied by simultaneous GIWAXS (grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering) and GISAXS (grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering), revealing knowledge about crystal growth and the formation of different morphologies observed using TEM (transmission electron microscopy). These measurements show that there is a strong relationship between precursor structure and heterojunction nanomorphology. A combination of TAS (transient absorption spectroscopy) and photovoltaic device performance measurements is used to show the intricate balance required between charge photogeneration and percolated domains in order to effectively extract charges to maximize device power conversion efficiencies. This study presents a strong case for xanthate complexes as a useful route to designing optimal heterojunction morphologies for use in the emerging field of hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells, due to the fact that the nanomorphology can be tuned via careful design of these precursor materials.

1. Introduction
Interest in hybrid organic/inorganic blend photovoltaic technologies has increased markedly in recent years, with efficiencies now reaching 5.5%.[1] These technologies are desirable due to the promise of their ability to incorporate the attractive qualities of both materials, mainly the ability to solution process organic materials, and the superior mobility and chemical stability of inorganic materials. To date, hybrid devices have been fabricated using a wide range of inorganic materials, such as CdS,[2] CdSe,[3] Sb2S3,[4] PbS,[1,5] PbSe,[1] Bi2S3,[6] CuInS2[7] and ZnO[8] nanoparticles, along with many organic materials, such as conjugated polymers, low band gap polymers as well as small-molecular organic absorbers.[9] One of the major challenges with hybrid solar cells is the difficulty with processing both inorganic and organic materials in one step from the same solvent, due to the inherently different chemical and physical properties of both components. This problem is traditionally tackled by the use of organic capping ligands which allow for both components to be deposited together, but which also inhibit charge separation and inter-nanoparticle transport.[10] Therefore, typically ligand exchange processes are applied to reach high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).[9a]

Recently, we developed an alternative method to the use of capping ligands by utilizing the thermal decomposition of a soluble precursor material to the inorganic nanoparticles, namely metal xanthate complexes.[11] Thin films comprising of a metal xanthate and polymer blend are spin coated from a common solvent and the metal sulfide phase is generated in situ with only gaseous by-products after a moderate (>120 °C) anneal in a nitrogen atmosphere. This method has been shown to give an increased charge generation yield and overall device performance compared to an equivalent device fabricated using the traditional ex situ method of blending nanoparticles with a polymer before thin film formation.[12] The in situ method is also potentially compatible with large-scale production, something that is seen as critical to the success of solution processed photovoltaic technologies[13] and the feasibility of preparing small modules on flexible substrates via the in situ route using metal xanthates as precursors and doctor blading as a coating method has already been demonstrated.[14]

Although there have been extensive studies on how to optimize the charge generation in these systems,[15] little is known about how to influence the nanomorphology of in situ prepared hybrid solar cells and the in situ formation process of the nanoparticles themselves. In analogy to polymer/fullerene solar cells, it is reasonable to assume that the nanomorphology of the absorber layer will be a key factor in further optimizing the PCEs of this emerging type of solar cells.[16] The crucial influence of the nanomorphology has been clearly shown for polymer/nanoparticle hybrid solar cells prepared via the classical approach using ligand-stabilized nanoparticles. Several reports demonstrated the effects of different nanoparticle shape (spherical,[3] rod-shaped)[17] or size[18] on device performance.

For in situ prepared hybrid solar cells, recent studies show that for different organic/inorganic material combinations quite different absorber layer morphologies are obtained. For example, using metal xanthates as precursors, comparatively big domain sizes have been observed for P3HT/CdS absorber layers,[11a] while well mixed phases were observed in PSiF-DBT/CIS layers.[7] The fact that the metal xanthates used for the preparation of the P3HT/CdS layers had a small ethyl ligand moiety, while for the in situ preparation of the CIS nanoparticles xanthates with longer and branched alkyl side chains were used, suggests that the precursor design has an influence on the nanomorphology formation. Moreover, it was observed that by increasing the ratio of inorganic to organic phase, the domain sizes of the inorganic material increases,[15,19] which leads, however, to the problem that due to the reduced amount of organic phase, a balanced charge transport of electrons and holes might be not provided. In terms of nanoparticle shape, besides spherical nanocrystals, elongated Bi2S3 nanorods have also already been obtained in a polymer matrix using metal xanthate precursors.[20]

Currently, no systematic studies on how the nanomorphologies of in situ prepared absorber layers can be tailored in order to optimize the device performance exist. Therefore, for this study, we have chosen the material combination P3HT/CdS as a model system to investigate if the absorber layer nanomorphology can be tuned by the molecular design of the precursors. All previous studies on this material have focussed only on xanthate molecules with one common ligand moiety. In this study we not only attempt to gain an understanding on how the metal chalcogenide nanocrystals grow within the polymer matrix and how the nanomorphologies are formed, we also investigate the effect that small changes in the solubilizing alkyl groups of the precursors have on the nanocrystal growth and nanomorphology formation, as well as the photophysics of hybrid photoactive layers. To this end, we investigate five cadmium xanthates with different alkyl moieties, namely, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and 2,2-dimethylpent-3-yl, which is referred to as heptyl in the further course of the study (see Figure
1).

Figure 1 General chemical structure of the Cd-xanthate precursors used (bipyridine cadmium(II) dithiocarbonate) along with the different R Group moieties. It should also be noted that in the case of the heptyl xanthate, there are no pyridine adducts present, as due to the branched side chains, good solubility is already obtained without them.

Blends of five xanthate precursor materials (see Figure 1) and P3HT were spin coated and annealed at 160 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere to form the hybrid polymer/inorganic networks. These films were first investigated using TEM showing markedly different nanomorphologies. Moreover, the growth process of each system was then studied in detail using simultaneous GIWAXS (grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering) and GISAXS (grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering) during the annealing process to monitor the crystal growth and gain a better understanding of the formation of the different morphologies observed by TEM. Furthermore, the thin films were subjected to photophysical characterisation, including UV–VIS absorption, photoluminescence, fs-TAS (femto-second transient absorption spectroscopy) and μs-TAS (micro-second transient absorption spectroscopy) to observe which effects the different morphologies have on the photophysical processes, including polymer exciton lifetimes and the relative yields and lifetimes of free charge carriers, within the device active layers. Generally, it was observed that an increase in mixing resulted in a decrease in exciton lifetime and an increase in the relative yield of charge carriers. Finally series of complete devices were fabricated using an inverted device architecture of ITO/TiO2(dense)/CdS/P3HT:CdS(blend)/MoO3/Ag to measure the overall effect of ligand moiety on photovoltaic performance. These devices showed that the optimum nanomorphology for charge generation, i.e., good mixing, did not correlate with the optimum device performance and highlight the importance of being able to finetune hybrid heterojunctions at the nanoscale. Brief descriptions of all techniques can be found in the experimental section and full details can be found in the Supporting Information.

2. Results and Discussion
The morphology of in situ formed P3HT/CdS hybrid blend thin films was first studied using bright field TEM, typical images of which can be seen in Figure
2. From left to right the images show films fabricated using a xanthate precursor of increasing ligand moiety size, from ethyl through to heptyl. It is apparent that as the ligand moiety is changed the morphology of the blends changes, with the domain sizes within the films becoming smaller as a larger ligand is used. Upon close inspection of the TEM image of the heptyl sample (Figure 2, Heptyl), discrete particles can be seen. These particles, although still observable, become less easy to isolate visually when moving towards a smaller ligand moiety on the left hand side of the figure. It appears that an increase of the alkyl chain size of the precursors results in a reduction in the aggregation of the cadmium sulfide nanoparticles upon decomposition of the xanthate precursors. It is worth noting however that the TEM images only provide a top-down look at the morphology and although we can see a trend in this direction we can only assume that the landscape looks similar in the z-direction as well. The significantly different morphologies of the P3HT/CdS hybrid films as shown in the TEM images in Figure 2 support our hypothesis that molecular precursor design is a valuable tool for tuning the nanomorphology of in situ prepared polymer/nanocrystal absorber layers towards efficient charge generation and transport. However, target-oriented molecular design of the precursors requires knowledge of the processes going on during the in situ formation of these films.

The darker regions of contrast are indicative of a higher concentration of cadmium.

The potential reasons for the development of different nanomorphologies are numerous and could be, for example, influenced by differences in solubility or rather different miscibility with the used polymer P3HT, by different phase separation or crystallization behavior of the metal xanthates in the precursor film, by decomposition of the xanthates and subsequent nanocrystal growth at different temperatures, or by different growth kinetics of the nanocrystals. To understand the processes during the formation of the nanocomposite layers and to gain knowledge on which parameters are most critically influencing the formation of the different nanomorphologies, the thermal annealing step was thoroughly investigated on the nanometer scale. This was done, in particular, by time resolved GIWAXS as well as GISAXS measurements using synchrotron radiation.

To get a first indication about possible differences in the thermal decomposition of the different xanthates, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out. The results presented in Figure
3a show that the decomposition of ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl xanthates proceeds via a two-step scheme. The first decomposition step starts at approx. 70 °C and the second at about 120–130 °C. While the decomposition characteristics in the first step are similar in these samples, the second step is quite different. After a mass loss of about 18%, the ethyl xanthate has an onset of a steep mass loss at 122 °C while the phase of steep mass loss is shifted to slightly higher temperatures for propyl (125 °C), butyl (126 °C) and pentyl (130 °C) xanthates. Moreover, the slope of the mass loss in the second decomposition step decreases going to higher chain length of the xanthates’ ligand moiety. The heptyl xanthate shows a markedly different behavior. It is thermally stable up to a temperature of 135 °C and decomposes comparably fast in one step. This is possibly caused by the fact that in the heptyl xanthate no pyridine ligands, which lower the decomposition temperature of metal xanthates,[21] are present, or could be due to the decreased number of beta hydrogens available, which facilitate the Chugaev elimination. The mass loss during the conversion of the respective Cd-xanthates to CdS is between 68 and 72%, which matches well with the theoretical values taking the small uncertainties of the used measuring setup into account. Moreover, the Cd-xanthate-bipyridyl compounds lose about 5% less weight than theoretically expected. This might be due to incomplete complexing of all Cd-xanthate molecules with two pyridines.

The main peaks of both the hexagonal as well as the cubic phase are labelled with their Miller indices.

These distinct differences in the thermal decomposition behavior of the investigated metal xanthates suggest possible differences in the formation/crystallization of the CdS nanocrystals in the P3HT matrix. X-ray diffraction measurements of the P3HT/CdS nanocomposite layers prepared from the different Cd-xanthates after the thermal annealing step were performed to detect a possible variation of the crystal structure or the primary crystallite size of the CdS nanocrystals in the final stage after the heating process. Figure 3b shows the respective X-ray diffraction patterns and reference patterns for hexagonal CdS (PDF 41–1049) as well as cubic CdS (PDF 01–080–0019). The main peaks of both crystal structures are labelled with their Miller indices followed by the suffix h or c to indicate the hexagonal (wurtzite) or cubic (sphalerite) phase, respectively. Comparing the measured patterns with the reference patterns, it is apparent that the nanocrystals exhibit a blend of hexagonal and cubic crystal structure, which stems from mixed cubic and hexagonal stacking. This mixed layer stacking is not unusual for CdS nanocrystals and was already observed in other studies on CdS[22] as well as isostructural ZnS nanocrystals.[23] The relative amounts of cubic and hexagonal crystal phase in the samples are hard to determine due to the broadening of the peaks, however, the distribution ratio seems to be comparable in the ethyl, propyl, butyl, and pentyl samples. In the heptyl sample, the (100)h (002)h and (101)h peaks are more distinct, indicating that the overlapping (111)c peak is less intense than in the other samples, which lets us conclude that the amount of hexagonal phase might be higher in the heptyl sample. The fact that the middle peak (002)h is much more intense than the neighboring two indicates that there is also some cubic crystal structure present, as this peak is superimposed by the (111)c peak of the cubic crystal structure. Moreover, in all samples the (200)c peak is hardly visible in the diffraction patterns and also the (102)h peak is not as pronounced as the (103)h peak, which matches findings of a previous study investigating mixed hexagonal and cubic stacking.[23]

The better separation of the three peaks of the hexagonal phase in the heptyl sample could also originate from a bigger primary crystallite size in this sample, however, according to an estimation of the primary crystallite size using the Scherrer formula, the primary crystallite size in the heptyl sample is not significantly bigger than in the other samples. The broadening of the peaks for the estimation of the primary crystallite size via the Scherrer formula was determined by fitting the (110)h (220)c peak at approx. 44° 2 theta with the two individual peaks stemming from the hexagonal and cubic phase. For all samples, the primary crystallite size is approximately 7 ± 1 nm, which is in line with the size of the nanocrystals found in the TEM images. Thus, different crystallite sizes can be excluded as a possible factor leading to the different nanomorphologies of the hybrid absorber layers and it appears that the different morphologies originate from a different degree of agglomeration of the single nanocrystals.

Next, time resolved GIWAXS measurements were performed to obtain insight into the formation of the CdS nanocrystals in the P3HT matrix. The use of synchrotron radiation and the grazing incidence setup enabled us to probe directly approx. 150 nm thick films, comparable to those used in devices, at a time resolution of 11 s. These short intervals are necessary, as it is known from former experiments that the formation of the metal sulfides from metal xanthates occurs in a quite fast reaction step.[24] Due to a limited 2 theta range of the detector used, we focused on the formation of the broad and most intense peak of CdS in the samples (superimposition of the (110)h, (002)h, (101)h and (111)c reflections) which is situated around 27° 2 theta, and chose to monitor the range between 22.9 and 35° 2 theta. The temperature-dependent changes in the GIWAXS patterns during a heating run from room temperature to 200 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min are shown for the P3HT/Cd-butyl xanthate sample in Figure
4a. The GIWAXS patterns of all investigated samples are summarized in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. In Figure 4a, the evolution of the most intense peak of CdS can be clearly seen. The shape of the peak is slightly different to the one observed in the X-ray diffraction measurements shown in Figure 3b. This is due to peak broadening caused by the grazing incidence setup and also because of the fact that for the X-ray diffraction measurements much thicker films were used. However, also in the GIWAXS pattern, a shoulder at about 25.5° 2 theta similar to, but not as pronounced as in the X-ray diffraction pattern is observed. Moreover, in some experiments, as it can be seen also in Figure 4a, already at room temperature some weak peaks (around 23, 27, 33 and 34.5° 2 theta) are visible, which may stem from partial crystallizing of the Cd-xanthate in the precursor layer. These peaks from the precursor material are present in the sample until a certain temperature where they vanish shortly before the CdS nanocrystals are formed. This behavior is more visible in Figure 4b. Here, the normalized integrated intensity of the GIWAXS patterns of the different P3HT/metal xanthate samples calculated between 22.9 and 35° 2 theta are plotted versus reaction time along with the temperature ramp in grey. The vanishing of the peaks of the precursor material and the subsequent formation of the CdS nanocrystals can be also seen in Figure 4c, in which the temperature-dependent changes in the diffraction pattern during the heating run are visualized in a surface plot.

The increasing temperature (T) is indicated with a black arrow in the graph. b) Normalized integrated intensity of the GIWAXS patterns of the different P3HT/metal xanthate samples calculated between 22.9 and 35° 2 theta plotted versus reaction time and temperature. The corresponding GIWAXS patterns are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. c) Comparison of the temperature-dependent evolution of the most intense CdS peak during the heating run.

The surface plots illustrate that the ethyl and heptyl xanthates do not have peaks at room temperature, while in the propyl, butyl, and pentyl samples some of these previously discussed weak peaks are visible. In the pentyl xanthate sample these peaks are most significant. It is also apparent that these “precursor-peaks” disappear at different temperatures. The integrated intensity of the diffraction patterns starts to decrease in the propyl sample already slightly above 100 °C while it stays stable until about 130 °C in the butyl sample and until 135 °C in the pentyl sample. In the ethyl and heptyl sample no “precursor-peaks” are observed and in the integrated intensity only the formation of the CdS nanocrystals can be detected. The nanocrystal formation starts already at 125 °C in the ethyl sample, which is approximately 5–10 °C higher than the onset temperature of the fast second decomposition phase, as determined by thermogravimetric measurements (see Figure 3a). In the other samples, the onset of the nanocrystal growth is shifted to slightly higher temperatures (140 °C for the propyl and heptyl samples and 145 °C for the butyl and pentyl samples). The fact that peaks of the precursor material are observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the propyl, butyl and pentyl samples suggests that the agglomeration of the nanocrystals after the heating step is influenced by a phase separation of polymer and metal xanthate phase already in the precursor layer. However, for the ethyl sample no peaks of the precursors were found, which is surprising because the ethyl sample exhibits the largest domain sizes. It is possible that also in this sample the polymer and the metal xanthates phase separate, though the precursor molecules do not form crystalline domains and thus, no peaks are visible in the X-ray diffraction pattern. The observation that in the heptyl sample the polymer and nanoparticle phases are well mixed (see TEM images in Figure 2), lets us conclude that the solubility and the mixing with the polymer of the heptyl xanthate, due to the branched alkyl chains, is very high and as a result no pronounced phase separation occurs in the heptyl sample.

It is interesting that the nanocrystal growth is much slower in the ethyl sample compared to the others. This can be seen in the surface plots in Figure 4c and as well in the 3D-plots in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The formation of the main peak of CdS in the sample at around 27° 2 theta is quite smeared over a larger temperature range, which is a significant difference compared to the other samples, where fast and abrupt nanocrystal growth is observed. After this short nanocrystal growth phase, the intensity of the peak as well as the shape and width of the peak stay constant indicating no further nanocrystal growth in this last phase of the heating run.

Time-resolved GISAXS measurements were performed simultaneously with the GIWAXS measurements. The GISAXS patterns of the ethyl xanthate and the butyl xanthate at different temperatures during the heating run are shown in Figure
5. The areas for vertical integration are indicated with a red box in the GISAXS images and the resulting vertical cuts at qy = 0.058 nm−1 are presented in Figure
6. The GISAXS images as well as the vertical cuts of the full set of samples are summarized in Figure S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information.

The increasing temperature (T) is indicated with a black arrow in the graphs. c, d) Comparison of the evolution of the integrated intensities of the GIWAXS and GISAXS signals during the heating run.

The integrated intensities extracted from the GISAXS data reveal structural changes in the layers directly before the growth of the nanocrystals starts. These structural changes have their origin in the decomposition of the cadmium xanthates and evaporation of volatile decomposition products out of the layer, which leads to a compaction of the layer and an overall increase in electron density. This increase of electron density is also reflected in the shift of the Yoneda peak (qz ≈ 0.45 nm−1) towards higher q-values during the heating run. The idea that the structural changes are stemming from the decomposition of the precursors is also supported by the fact that the observed increase of the integrated intensity of the GISAXS signal occurs in the same phase of the heating run, where the peaks of the precursors vanish in the GIWAXS pattern, as it can be seen in Figure 6d.

Moreover, the GISAXS measurements suggest that there is an agglomeration of the nanocrystals after the growth phase in the ethyl sample, which is indicated by a further increase of the integrated intensity of the GISAXS signal after the nanoparticle growth (see comparison of the integrated intensities of GISAXS and GIWAXS signals in Figure 6c). This might be a reason for the formation of markedly bigger domain sizes in the ethyl sample. In all the other samples, no particle aggregation after the nanoparticle growth is observed (see Figure S4, Supporting Information), which lets us assume that the nanoparticle agglomerates found in the propyl, butyl and pentyl samples are mainly already determined by the phase separation of polymer and cadmium xanthates in the precursor layer as discussed before in the GIWAXS section.

After gaining insight into the growth of CdS via the decomposition of the different xanthate precursors, we turned the focus of our work to study the effect that the different precursor materials and their respectively different morphologies had on the photophysical properties of these hybrid heterojunctions. Spectroscopic studies were performed on thin films prepared in an identical manner to those previously studied in the GIWAXS and GISAXS measurements and investigated using TEM.

Considering first the steady-state absorption of these films, in Figure
7a it can be seen that the CdS nanoparticles absorb light in a complementary region of the spectrum compared to P3HT, highlighting one of the potential advantages that a hybrid system of this type offers. The spectra have been normalized at 520 nm and plotted against a measurement of neat P3HT. It is clear that there is already a distinct trend to accompany the observation of the different morphologies. In the absorption spectrum of P3HT (shown in black) a distinct shoulder is seen at ≈600 nm, a feature of the P3HT spectrum that is attributed to the degree of aggregation between adjacent polymer chains.[25] The relative size of this shoulder compared to the P3HT maximum absorption is a good indication of the level of aggregation of P3HT, or, in other words, is an indication of crystalline P3HT domain size. In Figure 7a, it can be seen that as the Cd-xanthate ligand moiety length is increased, the relative height of this shoulder decreases. This can be seen more clearly in Figure 7d, where the squares represent the relative absorption at 600 nm compared to the normalized absorption at 520 nm. The decrease in shoulder height indicates that as a larger ligand moiety is used, the aggregation of the P3HT decreases. This correlates also with XRD measurements (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), which show a general trend of decreasing P3HT crystallinity with increasing ligand moiety length used. This observation furthermore supports the TEM images where the P3HT domain size is visibly seen to decrease as a larger ligand moiety is used (Figure 2).

The nanomorphology of these photoactive layers was then probed by using the photophysical processes within these heterojunctions as an indicator. The approximate domain size of P3HT was investigated by studying the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of these films. Since the same polymer Mn and regioregularity was used for all samples, exciton quenching by CdS is believed to be the only cause of a reduced PL intensity. The P3HT was solely excited at a wavelength of 567 nm, the results of which can be seen in Figure 7b. There are two key observations to be made from these measurements as a longer ligand moiety is used: 1) the amount of emission from the P3HT decreases and 2) the emission is blue shifted. The emission data is summarized in Figure 7d, with the integrated emission relative to neat P3HT shown in circles. An increase in exciton quenching is a typical finding which indicates a reduction in the relative domain size of a polymer blended with an acceptor material and in this system it appears that as a longer ligand moiety is used an increase in quenching is observed.

We can attribute this to the P3HT excitons having, on average, a shorter distance to travel to a CdS interface, resulting in more excitons being quenched before they radiatively decay. The blue shifting in the spectral maximum is another indication of a reduction in aggregation of the P3HT, something that is observed when comparing the polymer emission in a dilute solution, where aggregation is at a minimum, and in thin film.[26] This has also been observed when the packing density of P3HT has been tuned through controlling the regioregularity.[27]

The decay kinetics of the P3HT excitons were studied using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). With this method both the photoinduced absorption of P3HT excitons and polarons can be observed.[28] We focus here on the kinetics of the P3HT excitons, which are the only absorbing species at 1270 nm.[29] Figure 7c shows the kinetics at a probe wavelength of 1270 nm following excitation with a 570 nm laser pulse with an intensity of 3.9 μJ cm−2. Relative lifetimes of these signals were calculated from determining the times at which the signals dropped to 1/e of the original amplitude and are shown as triangles in Figure 7d. It can be observed that as a larger ligand moiety is used the lifetime of the exciton is reduced. As with the other two steady-state techniques, this indicates that the domain size of the P3HT is decreasing and is in correlation with the TEM results (Figure 2).

Although these three techniques, together with the previous results, present a strong case for the larger ligand moiety having the effect of decreasing the domain size of P3HT, these measurements alone do not directly probe the charge generation within these hybrid heterojunctions. It is still possible that the larger leaving groups could increasingly disrupt the P3HT packing when leaving the film and lead to the previous observations. To rule out this possibility and to get further information on the effectiveness of these heterojunctions at generating charges, μs-TAS (micro-second transient absorption spectroscopy) was employed to measure both the relative number of free charges generated in these 5 different systems and also the lifetime of these transient species. It is noteworthy that fs-TAS can also be used to probe the yields and dynamics of polarons as well as excitons, however on the timescales measured there is still some overlap in signal between P3HT excitons and polarons at the characteristic polaron wavelength.[29] For this reason and the fact that μs-TAS has been extensively used previously to study this system[11,15] and others similar[28,30] it was chosen instead. Details of this particular setup are available in the Supporting Information.

The relatively low spectral overlap in the absorption of P3HT and CdS allows for each component to be excited reasonably selectively. Consequently, both the electron transfer reaction from P3HT to CdS and the converse hole transfer reaction from CdS to P3HT were separately studied. The P3HT was excited using a pump wavelength of 567 nm, where there is no absorption by the CdS, and the CdS was excited at 400 nm where there is only a small absorption contribution from the P3HT. In both cases the signals are scaled for the number of pump photons absorbed to account for small variations in film thickness between samples and also the difference in absorbance between samples at 400 and 567 nm. Both regions were pumped with the same approximate number of photons and were probed at a wavelength of 980 nm, which has previously been shown to correlate to the P3HT hole polaron.[6,11] The transient traces are presented in Figure
8a and b following the decay of the P3HT hole polaron but as a visual aid the amplitudes at 1 μs are plotted in Figure 8c and the amplitudes normalized to the maximum amplitude are shown in Figure 8d.

In Figure 8a and b the decays of all samples show the transient species to be relatively long lived, with all traces having a t50% (mΔA at 300 ns) of over 10 μs. There is also an observable difference in the amplitudes of all samples in both the CdS excitation and P3HT excitation case. It can be seen that in all cases there is a higher efficiency of charge generation when exciting the CdS in comparison to when exciting the P3HT, or, in other words, the hole transfer reaction is working more effectively than the electron transfer. This is something that has previously been observed in the P3HT/CdS system prepared using ethyl-xanthates, where the charge generation yields were studied thoroughly for a range of compositions of this heterojunction.[15b] The second observation is that, in both excitation cases, as a longer ligand moiety is used, the amount of charges generated steadily increases until the case of heptyl, where the yield is slightly reduced. This increase in charge generation yield can be explained by an increased mixing, as a more intimately mixed system results in excitons being generated closer to an interface and thus being more likely to separate into free charges before the exciton relaxes. This finding supports the observations in both the steady-state photoluminescence and fs-TAS exciton lifetime measurements of Figure 7. We can tentatively explain the reduction in yield for the heptyl case as being due to the absence of agglomeration of the nanocrystals, which leads to domain sizes becoming so small that either, there is a fast recombination pathway that is quicker than the measurement timescale, resulting in the observed signal being lower than expected by 1 µs, or, the reduced ability of the polaron to delocalize results in a lower driving energy for separation. This is consistent with the findings of Dayal et al.[31] who observed, using microwave conductivity measurements, that increasing the aspect ratio of QDs to rods and tetrapods resulted in an increase in charge generation. An alternative explanation could be that the increased amount of wurtzite relative to cubic CdS in these samples, as observed in the XRD (Figure 3b), could potentially change the polymer/nanoparticle interface and affect the amount of geminate recombination losses between bound polaron pairs.

When comparing the relative effect of changing ligand length on charge generation initiated by hole transfer compared to electron transfer, it can be seen that the effect is relatively small here compared to the more significant effect on the electron transfer. This can be most clearly seen in Figure 8d, where the data has been normalized. In this figure, it can be seen that when exciting the CdS phase, the difference between the ethyl and pentyl sample is an increase of approximately 50% whereas when exciting the P3HT there is an increase of 200% between the same two systems. This can be explained due to the difference in the nature of the species formed after excitation in CdS compared with in P3HT. Upon photon absorption in P3HT it is well documented that bound excitons are formed and they have a low diffusion length of <10 nm.[32] The lifetime of these excitons is indeed short-lived and is what was measured previously, using fs-TAS shown in Figure 8c. It is therefore expected that a finer mixing of both components will result in an increase in charge generation due to more P3HT domain sizes being reduced to a length scale of nearer the diffusion length.

The reason for this increase in mixing having less of an effect when photons are absorbed by the CdS is because, due to the higher dielectric constant, a bound exciton is not expected to be formed and instead free charges are likely to be present in the inorganic layer without the need to diffuse to an interface. These charges in CdS have been shown to have a much longer lifetime than the excitons in P3HT[29] allowing for longer diffusion pathways to an interface. We have also measured hole transfer from antimony sulfide to P3HT to occur over extremely long timescales.[33] This observation of hole transfer showing very little dependence on morphology in comparison to electron transfer was previously seen in this system whereby the hole transfer was found to be not very dependent on the composition of blends, whereas after P3HT excitation the amount of charges yielded was highly dependent on having a high amount of acceptor material.[15b] It is also expected that this observation is actually even more heavily pronounced than what is measured here as there is still a small amount of light absorption by the P3HT at 400 nm and it could be charges generated from absorption here that accounts for the small dependence on ligand moiety size.

Finally, a series of complete devices was fabricated to test the overall effect of tuning the morphology through ligand moiety design. Devices were fabricated of the structure ITO/TiO2(dense)/CdS/P3HT:CdS(blend)/MoO3/Ag, with the P3HT:CdS layer being identically fabricated to the films used throughout the study. Devices were tested using an AM 1.5 source, details of which can be found in the experimental section.

In Figure 9a the current voltage characteristics are presented for representative devices for each ligand used and in Figure 9b and c the average characteristic device parameters are shown for the top 10 devices in terms of PCE. This data is also summarized in Table 1. In Figure 9b we can see that the variation in device performance is mainly governed by the short circuit current, with the devices made with the propyl ligand showing both the highest current and efficiency. All other devices can be ordered by their short circuit current and power conversion efficiency and be seen to have the same trend. It is pertinent to note, however, that the trend in the short circuit currents does not match the trend previously observed in the charge generation yield, as measured by μs-TAS, whereby the films made with the pentyl ligand were found to generate the highest number of charges. A correlation between charge generation yield and short circuit current is one that has been seen in several all organic systems,[34] but is not what has been observed previously in this system. We recently reported on the mismatch between the optimum blend ratio for charge generation and the optimum for efficiency in complete devices.[15b] This was attributed to the fact that although a higher heterojunction surface area could be created by increasing the loading of the inorganic component within the polymer and as a result increase the charge photogeneration efficiency, at a certain loading this became so high that the domain size of P3HT was reduced to a point where the charges were not effectively extracted. A similar behavior was found for polythiophene/ZnO nanoparticle hybrid solar cells, where a finer mixed morphology led to higher charge separation yields, however, not to increased short circuit currents due to a limited hole mobility in the polymer phase because of the smaller domain sizes.[8] It is likely that an analogous problem is being observed here whereby at a given blend ratio the morphology has an optimum point where the balance between interface area and domain connectivity is found. In this system, it appears that this sweet-spot is found with the propyl ligand. In Figure 9c it can be seen that both the fill factor and open circuit voltage are reduced when a metal xanthate with a longer ligand is used. This is likely due to the finer mixing resulting in an increase in the non-geminate recombination.

3. Conclusion
In summary, this study shows how the nanomorphology of in situ prepared hybrid solar cells can be tuned efficiently by the design of the molecular nanocrystal precursors. Small changes in the structure of the used metal xanthates induce significant changes in the obtained absorber layer nanomorphologies. Longer alkyl chains of the xanthate moieties lead to a better mixing of the polymer and nanoparticle phase, to smaller domain sizes and a lower crystallinity of the polymer phase in the P3HT/CdS absorber layers. The formation of these different morphologies is determined by agglomeration of the nanocrystals, which have a similar size in all the investigated samples. As suggested by time resolved X-ray scattering measurements, the agglomeration of the nanocrystals is influenced by growth temperature and kinetics of the nanocrystals as well as phase separation of polymer and metal xanthate phase already in the precursor layer.

The different nanomorphologies strongly influence the optoelectronic properties of the absorber layers and in turn also the performance of the hybrid solar cells and a complex interplay between these parameters is disclosed by the performed characterizations. The highest level of quenching of the photoluminescence of the polymer phase by the CdS nanocrystals was found for the heptyl sample, indicating that the heptyl sample was the most intimately mixed. This was also supported by fs-TAS showing the shortest P3HT exciton lifetime in this system. However, optimum charge generation, probed by μs-TAS, was observed in the pentyl sample showing that in the heptyl sample, due to non-agglomerated nanocrystals, the domain sizes are most presumably too small for the efficient generation of long-lived charges, which is facilitated by bigger domain sizes. Overall, the best power conversion efficiencies were obtained with hybrid solar cells prepared using propyl xanthates. This originates from the fact that besides efficient charge generation also charge transport and recombination play a crucial role in the devices, which were found out to become more and more an issue when going to finer mixed morphologies.

The findings of this study will provide a valuable tool for further research in the emerging field of hybrid solar cells, in particular, for optimizing polymer/nanocrystal hybrid solar cells using non-toxic material combinations including Sb2S3, Bi2S3 or CuInS2 nanocrystals. These materials also have the advantage of having better suited absorption properties for solar cell applications compared to CdS. Moreover, the nanomorphologies of hybrid absorber layers prepared with these materials in combination with a conjugated polymer still leave room for optimization, and thus, we are confident that the performed study will assist to improve the PCEs of in situ prepared hybrid solar cells.

4. Experimental Section
Cadmium(II) dithiocarbonate syntheses were carried out as follows: potassium hydroxide was stirred in a 1:1 molar ratio with a primary alcohol (e.g., 1-propanol to form propyl xanthate) and a small amount of water. The solution was cooled in an ice bath followed by a dropwise addition of carbon disulfide to a slight excess (1.1 equiv.). The resulting slurry was stirred for 30 min before vacuum filtering and washing with diethyl ether. All potassium xanthate products were then recrystallized from methanol. To form the cadmium salts, an aqueous solution of the respective potassium xanthate compounds was added to a rapidly stirring aqueous solution of cadmium nitrate in a molar ratio of 2:1. The products were filtered and washed with water followed by methanol. In the case of all except heptyl, pyridine adducts were obtained by adding 2 equiv. of pyridine to a suspension of the cadmium xanthate in dichloromethane, solubilising the compound, followed by evaporation of the solvent. All xanthates were then recrystallized from acetone. The heptyl xanthate was synthesized slightly differently and the according procedure can be found in the Supporting Information along with 1H NMR spectra for all products.

Typical thin films were produced by the spin coating of a chlorobenzene solution of P3HT (Sigma Aldrich, >98% RR, Mn 54–75 kDa) (9.375 mg ml−1) and Cd-ethyl-xanthate (150 mg ml−1). When using Cd-xanthate precursors with a longer ligand moiety a higher concentration was used to obtain the same final blend ratio.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL 2000 MkII electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Films for TEM were fabricated on PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083, Ossila) itself spin coated onto glass to act as a water soluble sacrificial substrate. Free floating films were then transferred to copper grids for imaging in a ‘top-down’ fashion.

Steady-state absorption measurements were carried out with a Shimadzu 2600 spectrophotometer with an ISR-2600Plus Integrating Sphere Attachment. Photoluminescence measurements were made with a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-2.

Femto-second TAS was measured on a previously described set-up[29] using pump and probe pulses generated from the output of a Solstice Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spectra-Physics) with 800 nm 92 fs pulses with a 1 kHz frequency. The probe pulse was generated by a sapphire crystal and was split into a signal and a reference beam before the sample. The pump pulse of 570 nm was created using an optical parametric amplifier and a series of filters (TOPAS-NIRUVIS). It was then chopped mechanically to obtain a 500 Hz train of pulses. Both pump and probe pulses were focussed onto the same sample spot. TA spectra were calculated from the difference in detected probe light in presence and absence of the pump pulse.

Micro-second TAS measurements were performed by exciting the sample film under a dynamic nitrogen atmosphere using a dye laser pumped by a nitrogen laser. A 100 W quartz halogen lamp was used as a probe light source. The probe light passing through the sample film was detected with a silicon photodiode, amplified, and then measured using an oscilloscope. Full details of the setup can be found in the Supporting Information.

Thermogravimetric measurements were performed in helium atmosphere using a Netzsch Jupiter STA 449C (heating rate: 10 °C min−1). X-ray diffraction patterns were measured on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MRD diffractometer using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Simultaneous GISAXS and GIWAXS measurements were performed at the Austrian SAXS Beamline 5.2L of the electron storage ring ELETTRA (Italy)[35] using a similar setup as described before.[36] Details to the used setup can be found in the Supporting Information.

Cryptolepis buchanani Roem. & Schult. is widely used in folk medicine in Southeast Asia for treating muscle tension and arthritis. This study aimed to investigate an analgesic activity of the methanol extract of C. buchanani (CBE) in acetic acid-induced writhing response in mice, and to examine its anti-inflammatory activity in ethyl phenylpropiolate- (EPP-) induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. Its effects on cartilage degradation induced by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in porcine cartilage explant culture were also determined. This study demonstrated that CBE significantly reduced acetic acid-induced writhing response. It also inhibited edema formation in both EPP-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema models. In cartilage explant culture, CBE significantly reduced the sulfated glycosaminoglycan and hyaluronan released into culture media while it reserved the uronic acid and collagen within the cartilage tissues. It also suppressed the matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity with no effect on cell viability. In conclusion, CBE shows analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective effects in this preliminary study. Therefore, CBE may be useful as an alternative treatment for osteoarthritis.
==== Body
1. Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder characterized by destruction of articular cartilage and periarticular bone remodeling [1]. A World Health Organization report on the global burden of disease indicates that knee OA is likely to become the fourth most important global cause of disability in women and the eighth most important in men [2]. Because of the higher prevalence of OA, it is a more costly disease than rheumatoid arthritis in economic terms [3].

In OA, degradation of extracellular matrix component and consequent gradual articular cartilage destruction is caused by an increase in cartilage catabolism and a decrease in cartilage anabolism [4]. Clinically, this cartilage pathology is often accompanied by pain and joint dysfunction. Pain in and around the joint is the first and predominant symptom of OA that makes the patient seek treatment. Some patients also have inflammatory flares characterized by the episodic synovial effusion and increased pain and morning stiffness [5]. Goals of managing OA include controlling pain, maintaining and improving the range of movement and stability of affected joints, and limiting functional impairment [2, 6]. Approximately one-third of direct OA cost is allotted for medications, much of which goes toward the analgesic agents [3]. However, many patients suffer from a peptic ulcer side effect of the synthetic analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The intensive searching for alternative drug with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective properties especially from natural sources such as herbs for the treatment of OA is an important research effort.


Cryptolepis buchanani Roem. & Schult. (Asclepiadaceae) is a climbing tree found in evergreen forest in Thailand, China, India, Nepal, and Indo-China. It is widely used in folk medicine in Southeast Asia [7]. In Thailand, C. buchanani known as “Thao En On” has been used for treating inflammatory conditions such as muscle and joint pain [7–10]. Its stems are used in the treatment of muscle tension, stiffness of tendon, and arthritis [8, 10]. Its leaves are used as poultice on inflamed area for the treatment of myalgia and arthritis [10]. Few studies have examined the anti-inflammatory effect of this plant and found that its extract could reduce inflammation both in in vitro and in vivo studies [7, 11]. However, scientific reports of the analgesic and chondroprotective activities of C. buchanani are limited. The objectives of this study were therefore to evaluate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of C. buchanani methanolic extract (CBE) in animal models and its chondroprotective effect in cartilage explants.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals
Carrageenan and ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP) were obtained from Fluka Chemical Co., Ltd. (USA). Acetic acid was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, F.R. Germany). Indomethacin, chondroitin sulfate C, D-glucuronic acid lactone, hyaluronan (from human umbilical cord), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and recombinant-human interleukin-1β were obtained from Sigma (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

2.2. Plant Material and Extract Preparation
The stems of C. buchanani were collected in Chiang Mai province and a voucher specimen BKF no. 137513 was deposited at the Forest Herbarium, Royal Forestry Department, Bangkok, Thailand. Dried and finely powdered stems, 3.85 kg, was percolated at room temperature with 4 × 64 L of methanol. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and freeze dried to give 452 g of the crude extract. The HPLC fingerprints of CBE were shown in Figure 1.

2.3. Animals
Male Spraque-Dawley rats weighing 40–60 g and 100–120 g as well as male Swiss albino mice weighing 30–40 g were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. All animals were kept in a room maintained under environmentally controlled conditions of 24 ± 1°C and 12 h light-dark cycle. The animals had free access to water and food and were acclimatized at least one week before starting the experiments. All animals received the test drugs in an equivalent volume of 0.1 mL/10 g body weight. Control groups received the same volume of vehicle by the same route. All procedures involving the use of animals were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, Chiang Mai University (protocol number 20/2551).

2.4. Acetic Acid-Induced Writhing Response in Mice [12, 13]
Male Swiss albino mice weighing 30–40 g were divided into 5 groups, 6 rats per group. Methanol extract of C. buchanani at doses of 60, 125, and 250 mg/kg or indomethacin at dose of 5 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally 30 min before the acetic acid injection. The control group received 5% Tween 80 (vehicle). A writhing response, a surrogate of pain, was produced by an injection of an aqueous solution of 0.75% acetic acid in a volume of 0.1 mL/10 g body weight into the peritoneal cavity; the animals were then placed in a transparent plastic box. The number of writhes, a response consisting of contraction of abdominal wall, pelvic rotation followed by hind limb extension, was counted during continuous observation for 15 min beginning from 5 min after the acetic acid injection. The number of writhes was compared between the treatment and the control group.

2.5. Ethyl Phenylpropiolate- (EPP-) Induced Ear Edema in Rats [14]
Male Spraque-Dawley rats weighing 40–60 g were divided into 3 groups, 5 rats per group. Ear edema was induced by the topical application of EPP 20 µL/ear (EPP in acetone at concentration 50 mg/mL) to the inner and outer surfaces of each ear by an automatic microliter pipet.

The extract and indomethacin at dose 1 mg/mL were dissolved in 5% DMSO in ethanol and applied topically in a volume of 20 µL to inner and outer surfaces of the ear just before the irritant. The control group received 5% DMSO in ethanol only. Before and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after edema induction, the thickness of each ear was measure with digital vernier caliper. The increase in the ear thickness was compared between the treatment and control groups.

2.6. Carrageenan-Induced Hind Paw Edema in Rats [15]
Male Spraque-Dawley rats of 100–120 g body weight were divided into 5 groups, 6 animals per group. The extract at doses of 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg, indomethacin at dose of 10 mg/kg or vehicle (5% tween 80 in control group), were given intraperitoneally 30 min prior to carrageenan injection. Lambda carrageenan was prepared as 1% suspension in sterile NSS. A volume of 0.05 mL of 1% carrageenan was injected intradermally into the plantar side of the right hind paw of an unanesthetized rat restrained in a plastic cage to induce paw edema, a surrogate of inflammation.

Foot volume of animal was determined by means of a volume displacement technique using a plethysmometer (model 7150, Ugo Basile, Italy). The right hind paw was immersed into the measuring chamber containing 0.05% NaCl in distilled water, exactly to and ink mark at anatomical hair line. Each paw volume was obtained from the average of 3 readings. The paw volume was measured prior to and at 1, 3, and 5 h after carrageenan injection. The edema volume of the treatment groups were compared to that of the control group.

2.7. Cartilage Explant Culture [16]
Articular cartilage was dissected from the metacarpophalangeal joints of pigs aged 20–24 wk. Cartilage discs (3 mm2) were biopsied from the weight-bearing region of the articular surface. Randomly selected explant discs (3 per well, approximately 30 mg in total) were cultured in a 24-well tissue culture plate with serum-free medium, DMEM containing 200 units/mL penicillin and 200 μg/mL streptomycin. The explants were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Normal control group was the group with no treatment. Recombinant human interleukin-1β (rHuIL-1β), 15 ng/mL, was added to culture media to induce cartilage degradation in the presence or absence of CBE. As a positive control, culture medium supplemented with diacerein was used. Treatments were performed with triplicated wells using tissue from the same animal donor. Conditioned media were collected on day 3 of culture and stored at −20°C until analysis.

2.8. Dye Binding Assay [17]
The sulfated glycosaminoglycan (s-GAG) concentrations were determined using a colorimetric dye binding assay modified by Farndale et al. The assay is based on a metachromatic shift in absorption as a complex compound is formed in a mixture of 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) and the s-GAG in the sample and standard. The dye solution was made by adding 16 mg of DMMB to 5 mL ethanol to 2 g of sodium formate and 2 mL of formic acid in a total volume of 1 L at pH 3.5. The maximum absorbance of the dye solution was at 620 nm. This solution was stored at 4°C in a dark bottle. Chondroitin 6-sulfate (CS-C) standards (0–40 μg/mL: 50 μL) or samples (50 μL) were transferred to a microtitre plate. The dye solution (200 μL) was added immediately to each well and absorbance was measured at 620 nm; a precipitate might form on standing. A standard curve of CS-C concentration and absorbance 620 nm was plotted. The concentration of CS-C in the sample was calculated from the standard curve.

2.9. A Competitive Inhibition-Based ELISA for Hyaluronan (HA) 
Microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated at 4°C overnight with umbilical cord HA (100 μL/well) in the coating buffer. Uncoated area was then blocked with 150 μL/well of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the incubating buffer for 60 min at 25°C. After washing, 100 μL of the mixture, sample or standard competitor (HA Healon range: 39.06–10,000 ng/mL) in biotinylated HA-binding protein (1 : 100), was added. After incubation for 60 min at 25°C, plates were washed and then the peroxidase-mouse monoclonal antibiotin (100 μL/well; 1 : 4,000) was added and incubated for 60 min at 25°C. The plates were washed again and then the peroxidase substrate (100 μL/well) was added and incubated at 37°C for 20 min to allow the color to develop. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μL of 4 M H2SO4. The absorbance ratio at 492/690 nm was measured using the Titertek Multiskan M340 multiplate reader.

2.10. Uronic Acid Assay [18–20]
Hexosamine and uronic acid are the components of the repeating units of all glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Uronic acid is widely determined as the representative of GAGs in biological substances. This assay measures uronic acid content in the cartilages by the releasing of monosaccharide using acid hydrolysis. For a standard curve, 0 to 2.4 μg of glucuronic acid lactone or sample (5 μL of dilution; 1 : 10) in up to 60 μL of water was added to a test tube. Concentrated sulfuric acid-borate reagent (300 μL) was added to the tube and mixed. The tubes were then incubated at 100°C in a water bath for 10 min and cooled to room temperature in ice bath. The solution of carbazole 50 mg/40 mL absolute ethanol (12 μL) was added and mixed. The uronic acid reaction was incubated at 100°C in a water bath for 15 min. The absorbance of the pink to red color was read by spectrophotometer at 540 nm against distilled water blank.

2.11. Collagen Content Measured by Hydroxyproline (HPR) Assay [21]
The collagen content in the cartilage was calculated based on HPR determinations. A portion of papain-digested sample and culture medium was hydrolyzed with 6 M HCl for 14 h at 90°C and 24 h at 60°C. Samples (50 μL) were combined with 100 μL freshly prepared oxidizing solution (0.178 g chloramines-T in 15 mL n-propanol/10 mL ddH2O/25 mL citrate buffer (50 g citric acid monohydrate, 12 mL glacial acetic acid, 120 g sodium acetate trihydrate, 34 g NaOH to pH 6.0 in 1 L)) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were mixed with 0.5 mL Ehrlich's reagent (1 g p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 20 mL n-propanol, 6.6 mL perchloric acid, 15.6 mL ddH2O) and incubated at 60°C for 45 min, and absorbance at 570 nm was read by spectrophotometer. Samples were extrapolated against HPR standards between 0 and 10 μg/mL.

2.12. Gelatin Zymography [22]
This method was used to determine matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in tissue culture media. Its gelatinolytic activity was assayed by electrophoresis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using a vertical gel apparatus according to the method of Laemmli [23], with modification by which gelatin was included in the resolving gel. Gelatin type B (Sigma-Aldrich) was copolymerized at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL into 0.75 mm thick, 10% polyacrylamide gel. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2x sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Each sample was loaded to a well and the samples were electrophoresed for 200 min at 90 V. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed from the gel by washing 2 × 15 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature and incubated for 16 h at 37°C in activating buffer. The gels were subsequently stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 5 h at room temperature and destained with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid to reveal zone of lysis within the gelatin matrix. The gel was dried on a Whatman paper. Molecular weight standard markers were run on each gel. Gelatinolytic activity was detected as clear band against a background of stained intact gelatin-impregnated acrylamide gel.

Quantification of the gelatinolytic band on the zymogram was performed by densitometry. The image acquisition was done with an Agfa scanner (SNAPscan 1212), by using Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 program. The zymogram densitometry was achieved with an Acion Image software for PC (Scion Corporation, Frederick, Maryland, USA), working in the gel plot 2 mode.

2.13. Cell Viability Determined by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay [24]
Cell viability was assessed by measuring LDH activity via colorimetric assay. The increase of LDH activity in culture media was proportional to the number of cell lysis.

2.14. Statistical Analysis
The data from the experiments were expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical comparison between groups was analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance and post hoc least-significant difference test. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

3. Results
3.1. Effect of CBE on Acetic Acid-Induced Writhing Response in Mice
All 3 doses of CBE significantly reduced the number of writhes compared with the control group (Table 1). However, the percentage of inhibition of writhing by CBE 125 mg/kg was similar to that of CBE 250 mg/kg. Indomethacin 5 mg/kg decreased the number of writhes significantly when compared with the control and CBE groups (P ≤ 0.01).

3.2. Effect of CBE on EPP-Induced Ear Edema in Rats
The mean changes of ear edema thickness are shown in Table 2. CBE and indomethacin both at the dose of 1 mg/ear significantly reduced ear edema formation induced by EPP when compared with that of the control group (P ≤ 0.001). There was no significantly different effect between CBE and indomethacin groups.

3.3. Effect of CBE on Carrageenan-Induced Hind Paw Edema in Rats
Indomethacin 10 mg/kg and CBE at doses 250 and 500 mg/kg significantly decreased the carrageenan-induced hind paw edema volume when compared with the control group at every time point (Table 3). Although CBE at the dose of 100 mg/kg tended to reduce paw edema volume but significant reduction was found only at the 3rd h. At the 3rd and the 5th h, CBE dose dependently and significantly reduced paw edema.

3.4. Chondroprotective Effect of CBE in Porcine Cartilage Explants
After treatment for 3 days, IL-1β alone increased the release of s-GAG and HA into the culture media while significantly reduced uronic acid and collagen reserved in cartilage discs when compared with the normal control group (Figure 2). Coculture of IL-1β and CBE 50μg/mL significantly reduced s-GAG and HA level in the culture media, while significantly reserved uronic acid and collagen content in cartilage discs in comparison to the treatment of IL-1β alone. But these effects were not different from those of the normal control group. The results of CBE 50 µg/mL group were similar to those of diacerein 50 µg/mL group.

IL-1β significantly increased the activity of MMP-2 whereas CBE 50 µg/mL and diacerein significantly reduced MMP-2 activity (Figure 3). CBE 12.5 and 25 µg/mL also decreased MMP-2 activity but the reduction did not reach statistical significance.

3.5. Cell Viability Determined by LDH Assay
All doses of the plant extract (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) did not affect cell viability when compared to the control group (data not shown).

4. Discussion
CBE significantly reduced the acetic acid-induced writhing response in mice. It inhibited the edema formation in both EPP-induced rat ear edema and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. CBE significantly reduced the s-GAG and HA released from cartilage explants into the culture media while reserved the cartilage matrix molecules such as uronic acid and collagen. It also suppressed the MMP-2 activity with no effect on cell viability. CBE therefore exhibits promising analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective effects.

OA is a degenerative joint disease which is one of the most common arthritis. It is characterized by gradual loss of articular cartilage, hypertrophy of marginal bone (i.e., osteophytes), and subchondral bone sclerosis [25]. Pain management is the main indication for drug treatment in OA patients [26]. In folk medicine, stems of C. buchanani have been used to relief muscle and joint pain [8, 10]. In this study, we found that all doses of CBE given intraperitoneally could reduce the number of writhes in mice significantly when compared with the control group. The percentage of inhibition of CBE 125 and 250 mg/kg were similar. So CBE 125 mg/kg was probably a maximum analgesic dose. However, the analgesic efficacy of CBE was lower than indomethacin. A model of acetic acid-induced writhing response in mice is widely used as a screening analgesic model. Acetic acid possibly induces algesia by causing intra-abdominal tissues damage and release of pain-producing substances which excite pain nerve endings [12, 27]. These substances include H+, K+, histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandins (PGs), serotonins, and substance P [28]. Because this test lacks specificity [29], further tests should be performed to evaluate the mechanism of analgesic action of CBE.

Inflammation underlies the pathology in OA [30–32]. Human OA-affected cartilage expresses cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and spontaneously produces PGE2. It also produces other cytokines and mediators associated with inflammation such as nitric oxide, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [33]. NSAIDs and corticosteroids can reduce OA symptoms with varying improvement [31]. In this study, anti-inflammatory activity of CBE was assessed by using EPP-induced rat ear edema and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema models. EPP-induced rat ear edema model is a screening method for evaluating the anti-inflammatory activity of drugs. When EPP is applied to the rat ears, it increases vascular permeability and consequently ear edema by inducing the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, kinins and PGs [34]. CBE significantly reduced rat ear edema similar to indomethacin in this screening model. The other model, carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, is considered as an acute inflammatory process and is well suited for comparative bioassay of anti-inflammatory agents [15]. The paw edema induced by carrageenan is biphasic. The initial phase, during the first hour after carrageenan injection, consists of the release of histamine and serotonin followed by bradykinin [35, 36]. In the second phase, around 3 h and lasts about 7 h after carrageenan injection, PGs play a major role [35–38]. It has been shown that the inhibition of carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema after the 3rd h correlates well with the therapeutic effects of most effective anti-inflammatory agents [37]. CBE 250 and 500 mg/kg significantly reduced edema volume at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th h when compared with the control group but this effect was less than those of indomethacin. Thus, the inhibitory effect of CBE might be partly due to the inhibition of synthesis and/or release of those mediators, especially the COX products. Laupattarakasem et al. [7] has studied the anti-inflammatory activity of the 50% methanol extract of C. buchanani. They found that, in the calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated rat leukocyte model, the extract inhibits both thromboxane B2 and leukotriene B4 which are the products of COX and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, respectively. It also inhibits TNF-α released from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cell line [7]. The inhibitory effect of their extract on arachidonic metabolism supports the results of rat ear and paw edema models in our study.

Our results showed that CBE had analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects; these findings supported the traditional uses of C. buchanani for arthritis treatment [7–11]. The other interesting property of the agents used for treating arthritis is chondroprotective activity because the important role of the cartilage in joint function is a shock absorber during loading and joint motion [39]. In inflammatory process, the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines causes an unbalanced chondrocyte metabolism leading to the destruction of extracellular matrix and subsequent cartilage degradation [40]. We postulated that CBE had an anticytokine-induced cartilage degradation effect. One of the most important cytokines that induced cartilage degradation is IL-1β. Therefore, in this study, IL-1β was used to induce cartilage degradation. It can induce the proteolytic molecules involved in cartilage degradation such as MMP and a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) [41, 42]. IL-1β can stimulate the production of PGE2 by chondrocytes. PGE2 could activate MMPs, aggravate joint inflammation, stimulate bone resorption, and modulate the immune response [43, 44]. IL-1β also decreases the anabolic activity of chondrocytes by reducing PGs and collagen synthesis [41]. In addition, the upregulation of IL-1β and IL-1β-converting enzyme have been found in human OA cartilage [45]. An intra-articular injection of recombinant porcine IL-1β into the pig knee joint induces the biochemical changes similar to those seen in OA [46]. After induction of cartilage degradation, CBE significantly reduced the s-GAG and HA releasing from the cartilage into the culture media while it reserved the cartilage matrix molecules such as uronic acid and collagen within the cartilage tissues. These effects were similar to those of diacerein. CBE also significantly suppressed the activity of MMP-2, a gelatinase A enzyme. MMP-2 digests gelatins and cleaves collagen type IV and V. Other substrates of gelatinase are elastin, aggrecan, and cartilage link protein [47]. These results firstly revealed the chondroprotective activity of CBE against the inflammatory cytokine-induced cartilage degradation. These may be associated with the inhibitory effects of CBE on MMPs expression via IL-1β-induced NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, the further studies for evaluating the molecular mechanism of action should be performed.

The limitation of this study is that the active compound(s) of CBE has not been identified yet. However, previous studies revealed that nicotinoyl glucoside alkaloid and pyridine alkaloid (buchananine) were found in the stems of C. buchanani [48, 49]. The contribution of these constituents and other bioactive compounds to pharmacological activities of CBE warrants further investigation.

5. Conclusion
CBE shows the analgesic, anti-inflammatorily and chondroprotective activities while it has no toxicity in cartilage explants. Therefore, CBE may be useful as an alternative for the treatment of OA. Further investigations to identify the mechanisms of actions and the active compound(s) of this extract are warranted.

The present study aims to investigate the potential mechanism of linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (LRSC) isolates collected from our hospital.

Methods
The susceptibilities of 5 Staphylococcus capitis isolates displaying resistance towards linezolid were determined by E-test. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and DNA sequencing were used to investigate the potential molecular mechanism. Clonal relatedness between these strains was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

Results
The MICs of linezolid on these 5 isolates were >256 μg/mL. The G2603T mutation was observed in the domain V of the 23S rRNA with cfr gene being also widely detected among these 5 strains. PFGE analysis displayed close genetic relatedness between these linezolid-resistant isolates.

Conclusions
The emergence of LRSC isolates carrying G2603T mutation in the domain V of the 23S rRNA and harboring cfr gene in our hospital may pose a potential challenge to the public health.

Background
Linezolid is the first member of an entirely new class of antibiotics that can inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome via interaction with the 23S rRNA of gram-positive bacteria [1]. Based on the unique mechanism of action, it is highly effective in the treatment of serious infections caused by antibiotic resistant gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci [1]. At the introduction of linezolid, it was claimed that there would be no cross-resistance to linezolid and resistance would be rare and difficult for the bacteria to develop. However, linezolid-resistant staphylococci and enterococci have been increasingly reported in recent years [2-5], since the first case report on the emergence of linezolid-resistant MRSA in North America in 2001 [6].

The mutations at the central loop of the domain V region on the 23S rRNA gene have been well recognized as the main mechanism mediating resistance to linezolid [6,7]. The acquisition of the chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance (cfr) gene encoding the 23S rRNA methyltransferase and modifying adenosine at position 2503 in the 23S rRNA has been frequently reported [2]. In addition, mutations or deletions in genes encoding the 50S ribosomal subunit proteins L3 or L4 have also played important role [8-10]. Up to date, the linezolid-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (LRCoNS) isolates have frequently emergenced among patients in many countries including North America (USA, Mexico), South America (Brazil), Europe (Greece, Spain, Italy, France, and Ireland), and Asia (India) [2,5,7,8]. However, such strains have rarely been reported in China [3,4,11], especially for the linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (LRSC) isolates [12]. In the present study, we report the emergence and potential clonal dissemination of 5 LRSC isolates among a tertiary care hospital of China.

Methods
Bacterial strains and data collection
A total of 29 LRSC isolates were continuously recovered from the blood (n = 28) and catheter (n = 1) from 5 hospitalized patients in 2 different wards at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (Nanjing, China) between September, 2012 and February, 2014. Among them, 5 LRSC isolates recovered from the blood (n = 4) and catheter (n = 1) were further analyzed in this study. And 4 linezolid-susceptible S. capitis (LSSC) isolates (SA01, SA02, SA03, SA04) from 2 wards during the same period were used as control. Blood culture was implemented according to the principle of double-sided bottles, the blood samples were processed using the BacT/Alert automated system (bioMerieux, France) and subcultured on Colombia plate containing 5% sheep blood (bioMerieux, France). Catheter tips were inoculated on Colombia blood agar by roll pate method. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were identified by colony morphology, gram staining, catalase testing and coagulase assays. The confirmation of Staphylococcus capitis was performed by using Vitek 2 Compact GP card (bioMerieux, France) combined with additional sequencing for the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) gene as described below. Clinical data such as the clinical features, laboratory results, and treatment were retrieved from the medical records department. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study.

16S rRNA sequencing for species identification
Chromosomal DNA was extracted from overnight cultures of these isolates grown on Colombia plate containing 5% sheep blood (bioMerieux, France) using the Qiagen DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Molecular identification of the strains was performed by PCR with primes of 5′-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG-3′ and 5′-TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′, which generated a 1.4- kilobase-pair (kbp) amplicon. Amplification was carried out using Ex Taq™ DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The 25 μl reaction mixture for the PCR assays contained the following: 10 mM Tris/HCL (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM deoxynucleotide triphosphate and 25 pmol of each primer. Amplification conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min as well as 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were sequenced by using an ABI 3730XL fluorescence sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) after they were purified by using the purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by using the disc diffusion tests (Oxoid) on Mueller Hinton agar (bioMerieux, France) according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines [13], with the following antibiotics being included: penicillin (30 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), levofloxacin (5 μg), chloromycetin (30 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (25 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), clindamycin (15 μg), ofloxacin (5 μg), amikacin (30 μg), rifampicin (5 μg) and linezolid (30 μg). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, clindamycin and linezolid were determined using CLSI agar dilution methodology and the MICs of linezolid on the 5 LRSC isolates was also determined by E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). S. aureus ATCC 25923 and 29213 were used as the quality controls in parallel.

Molecular detection of resistance genes
Amplification for cfr gene, the domain V of the 23S rRNA gene and the genes encoding ribosomal proteins L3, L4 and L22 was implemented as previously described by Mendes et al. [8]. The amplicons were purified by using Qiagen DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to sequencing. The sequence similarity was determined by using the BLAST program from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
PFGE was carried out according to the protocol described by Yang et al. [11] with the CHEF Mapper XA system (Bio-Rad). Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with Sma-I and electrophoresis was conducted at 6 V/cm for 22 h at 14°C, with initial and final pulses conducted for 3.0 and 40.0 s, respectively. The PFGE types were defined on the basis of DNA banding patterns according to the criteria of Tenover et al. [14].

Results
Clinical data
29 LRSC isolates were collected from these 5 patients. The number of samples taken from each patient and the no. of isolates taken has been showed in Table 1. However, we just took 5 strains including SA10106, SA13096, SA23062, SA20062, and SA11026 from these 5 patients respectively for further analysis in our study. As it was shown in Table 2, medical records showed that SA10106 and SA13096 out of the 5 LRSC isolates were isolated from different wards during the same time period, SA23062 and SA20062 from the same wards during the near time period. However, SA11026 was isolated in 2014, which was quite later than the previous 4 isolates. It’s noteworthy that 4 LRSC isolates were collected from ICU, only 1 from the department of infectious diseases. In addition, among the 5 patients carrying LRSC isolates, 3 ones received linezolid for treatment which lasted more than 13 days with the total dosage being above 7.8 g.Table 1

Molecular identification of strains
Further 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis confirmed that all the 5 LRSC isolates and the 4 LSSC isolates belonged to S. capitis, which was in accordance with conventional method. The phylogenetic tree constructed by neighbor-joining method showed the position of our isolates with respect to S. capitis strain BQEP2-01d with the accession number of FJ380956.1.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Similar multidrug-resistant phenotypes were observed in the 5 LRSC isolates (Table 2). All the 5 isolates were resistant to linezolid indicated both by disk diffusion testing and by the E-test. However, the MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin were ≤ 2 μg/mL, and the MICs of tigecycline were 0.25 μg/mL. In contrast, all the LSSC isolates showed susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested which are quite different from the susceptibilities of LRSC isolates.

Genetic analysis and resistance-related genes of LRSC isolates
PCR mapping and sequencing results showed that G2576T, the most common mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene [10], was not be detected in all of the 5 LRSC isolates. However, a new mutation, G2603T, which had not been previously reported in S. capitis, was observed in these 5 isolates with the cfr gene being simultaneously prevalent among them (Table 2), while none of the 4 LSSC isolates carried cfr gene and had mutations in the 23S rRNA. Moreover, the mutations in the L3, L4 or L22 were not detected among LRSC isolates in our current study. The genetic relationship between these LRSC strains (Figure 1) revealed a clonal dissemination of LRSC isolates as displayed by the identical Sma-I digestion patterns.Figure 1

Discussion
With the frequent use of linezolid in clinical treatment, the LRCoNS strains have been increasingly isolated from health care setting. In this study, we report the linezolid resistance mediated by the G2603T mutations accompanied the prevalence of cfr genes in LRSC isolates and a clonal dissemination of LRSC strain among 5 patients at a tertiary-care hospital between September 2012 and February 2014 in Nanjing, Jiangsu province of China.

As it has been previously reported, LRCoNS isolates only kept sensitivities to vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, tigecycline and rifampicin in vitro [2]. Previous report showed that LRCoNS strains were isolated with the mean time of 11.0 ± 8.0 days after patients were treated with linezolid, although in a few cases, the resistant strains were acquired as a result of cross-infection [2]. This may provide further evidence to the proposal that the linezolid usage is an independent risk factor for development of LRCoNS strains [5]. This has been partly evidenced by the founding in our study that 3 out of 5 patients carrying LRSC isolates received linezolid therapy at least for 13 days with a total dose of 7.8 g before the isolation of LRSC. Taking into account of the isolation of the same LRSC clone among these 5 patients and the time periods of the strains being isolated, we speculate that it may be a clonal dissemination of LRSC strain [15].

Generally, cfr methylation confers resistance to 5 classes of 50S ribosomal subunit-targeted antibiotics defined by the PhLOPSA phenotype, including phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A [10]. And cfr-carrying staphylococci therefore display multi-drug resistant phenotype, which is in agreement with the resistance profiles of our isolates (Table 2). Noteworthily, the cfr gene has been found primarily on plasmids, which can be transferred between staphylococci. In a recent paper, cfr gene has been described to play a decisive role in mediating resistance to linezolid [11]. The identification of a high incidence of cfr among our LRSC strains indicates a probability of horizontal gene transfer, which alerts us the necessity of strengthening the implementation of infection and control measures.

Additionally, previous studies demonstrated that △His 146 and Gly155Arg in L3 in laboratory-derived S. aureus and mutations within a conserved region of the L4 protein (63KPWRQKGTGRAR74) have been associated with cross-resistance to linezolid in Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. aureus and Clostridium perfringes [9,16,17]. Nevertheless, such resistance mechanisms were not detected in ribosomal proteins L3, L4 or L22 of the 5 LRSC isolates in our study. Instead, we observed a novel mutation in the 23S rRNA gene [G(2603)T] which is quite different from the frequent mutations in the central loop of domain V of the 23S rRNA in most linezolid-resistant isolates, such as enterococci and staphylococci. As far as we know, G2528U, G2576U, and G2505A have been identified in linezolid-resistant enterococci, G2447U and G2576U in linezolid-resistant S. aureus [2,10], and C2534T, G2447T, G2576T, T2504A, C2109T and G2474T in the increasing LRCoNS which was correlated with nosocomial transmission [2]. It’s worthy to note that the most common mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene, G2576T, was also not detected in our 5 LRSC isolates, whereas, G2603T was detected in all these 5 isolates. And the presence of G2603T mutation has been reported to be crucial for conferring resistance to linezolid in S. epidermidis [18] and S. hominis subsp. hominis [19]. However, there has been no report on the G2603T mutation in S. capitis isolate so far. In addition, it was found that the degree of linezolid resistance is associated with the number of mutations occurring in the copies of the 23S rRNA coding gene [20]. In our study, the entire 23S rRNA gene of the LRSC isolates were not sequenced for all copies, it is possible that other resistance mechanisms may co-exist in these strains.

S. capitis has been involved in biofilm related infections such as endocarditis, urinary tract infection, and catheter-related bacteremia. Hospital outbreaks caused by LRCoNS have been reported in the United States, Ireland, and Spain [21]. It has also been reported that S. capitis is emerging as an opportunistic pathogen in newborn babies [22]. The presence of LRSC isolates in healthcare setting therefore has been a major concern based on the bacteremia and catheter-related infections that they frequently caused. Since resistance has most commonly occurred in most patients undergoing long-term linezolid therapy [2], and the heavy use of linezolid in the patients may create substantial selection pressure in favor of linezolid-resistant isolate [5]. Thus, prudent use of linezolid in clinical treatment becomes very important.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the prevalence of cfr gene and the existence of G2603T mutation together lead to the resistance of our strains to linezolid. In addition, the clonal dissemination of such LRSCs may pose a potential threat to the public health.

The aim of this study was to compare outcomes when the upper and lower thoracic regions were used as the site of proximal instrumentation to treat adult spinal deformity.

Methods
MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane library searches were performed to identify studies that compared outcome measures when the upper and lower thoracic vertebrae (UTV and LTV, respectively) were used as the site of proximal instrumentation. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated for continuous outcomes, and the relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes.

Results
Seven articles (n=554 patients) met the final inclusion criteria, and we compared the outcome measures of a long fusion extending to the upper and lower thoracic regions. The pooled analysis revealed that extending fixation into the upper thoracic region decreased the risk of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) revision surgery (RR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90, p<0.05). The operation time (WMD: 0.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.39, p<0.05) and estimated blood loss (WMD: 0.59, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85, p<0.05) were significantly greater in the UTV group than in the LTV group. No significant differences were found in the Scoliosis Research Society pain, self-image, function, mental health, subtotal, satisfaction or total scores; the total number of complications or the total number of revision surgeries.

Conclusions
Long posterior fixation extending into the upper thoracic region reduces the incidence of revision surgery related to PJK; however, it increased the operative level resulting in a longer operative time and greater estimated blood loss. This initial analysis indicates that extending fixation to the upper thoracic region is appropriate for patients who are likely to develop PJK following initial scoliosis correction.

Strengths and limitations of this study
This is the first meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of the upper and lower thoracic vertebrae (UTV and LTV, respectively) as the upper instrumented vertebra for correction of degenerative adult spinal deformity.

The quality of each included study was assessed by methodological index for non-randomised studies and with high scores.

No obvious publication bias was observed by Begg's and Egger's tests.

Most of the pooled results showed good consistency (low heterogeneity among studies).

No randomised controlled studies were found in this review, and there was no consistent definition of which vertebra constituted UTV or LTV among studies.

Introduction
The global incidence of adult spinal deformity (ASD) is increasing as the elderly population grows. When non-operative treatment fails, ASD patients require surgical intervention.1 The main goals of surgical treatment for ASD are decompression and the re-establishment of coronal and sagittal balance.2
3 Selecting the surgical plan for ASD is a challenge for spinal surgeons.4–6

Posterior long fixation and fusion from the thoracic spine to the sacrum is one of the most common surgical treatments for ASD.7–9 However, there is some debate regarding the most appropriate upper instrumented vertebra for thoracolumbosacral fusion.10 Suk has suggested that fusing the upper thoracic vertebrae (UTV) rather than T10 might decrease adjacent segment disease, whereas Madjetko has reported that patients might benefit from upper thoracic spinal fusion.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no standard guideline for whether the UTV or lower thoracic vertebrae (LTV) are better for ASD treatment. In this meta-analysis, we compared the peri-operative parameters, clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and need for revision between the UTV and LTV as the site of the upper instrumented vertebra for ASD.

Materials and methods
This study was performed according to the preferred reporting items of the systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see online supplementary checklist S1).11

 Search strategy
A comprehensive MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library search was performed on 31 July 2016, by two independent authors (XF and XLS) using various combinations of the following search terms: ‘“proximal fusion level” or “upper instrumented vertebra” or “proximal junctional kyphosis”, or “upper instrumented thoracic vertebra” and “degenerative lumbar deformity”, or “adult lumbar deformity”, or “adult spinal deformity”, “degenerative lumbar scoliosis”, or “adult scoliosis”’. The search strategy developed for use with the MEDLINE database is shown in online supplementary table S1. Peer-reviewed articles reporting outcome measures for thoracolumbar and thoracolumbosacral instrumentation correction of ASD were collected. The reference lists of key articles were examined for eligible studies, and searches were performed with Google Scholar to avoid initial omissions.

 Inclusion criteria
All studies comparing the UTV and LTV as the upper instrumented vertebra for ASD were included. The inclusion criteria for the studies were as follows: (1) a minimum age of 18 years for all patients; (2) ASD, adult lumbar deformity or degenerative scoliosis as the primary indication for surgery; (3) a comparison of the UTV and LTV as the site of the upper instrumented vertebra for the treatment of ASD; and (4) a final postoperative follow-up of at least 12 months.

The following exclusion criteria were used: (1) case reports or case studies without comparisons; (2) data related to peri-operative parameters, clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and revisions that could not be extracted or calculated; and (3) a follow-up of <12 months. If multiple studies reported the same cohort of patients, only the most recent publication with the largest sample size was included.

Data items and extraction
The data parameters were predetermined and reported in the reference literature. The data extraction was performed in two phases by two reviewers (XF and XLS) and subsequently assessed for consistency by a third reviewer (AMW). A standardised form was used that included the following items: (1) basic characteristics, such as patient sample size, year of publication, country of the study, age and gender descriptors, and final postoperative follow-up period; (2) peri-operative data, such as operative time and estimated blood loss; (3) clinical outcomes, such as the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) pain level, self-image, function, mental health, subtotal, satisfaction, and total scores and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) score; (4) radiographic outcomes, including thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), proximal junctional kyphotic angle, C7 sagittal vertical axis (C7SVA) and pelvic incidence; and (5) postoperative complications and revisions related to proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK), pseudarthrosis and hardware implant failure.

Quality assessment of the included studies
The quality of the included studies was assessed based on the methodological index for non-randomised studies (MINORS).12 Twelve items were scored as ‘0’ (not reported), ‘1’ (reported but inadequate) or ‘2’ (reported and adequate). Two independent reviewers (XF and XLS) assessed the quality of the included studies.

Statistical analysis
The data suitable for the meta-analysis were evaluated with STATA software (V.12.0; StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). The weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated for continuous outcomes, and the relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes. A random-effect model was used to perform the pooled analysis.13–15 Heterogeneity was defined if the χ2 test was <0.10 or the I2 test was >30%. If heterogeneity was observed, a further sensitivity analysis was involved to omit one study and evaluate whether the other results were significantly affected. The publication bias was analysed using Begg's and Egger's tests.

Results
Literature search
A total of 254 potential records were identified through MEDLINE (n=158), Embase (n=94) and the Cochrane library (n=2). After 43 duplicate articles were excluded, 211 articles were screened for titles and abstracts, which eliminated 180 articles. One article16 was added through a Google Scholar search. In total, 32 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 25 were excluded because they were a ‘case report or case study without a comparison, a review article, a debate, an article from the same site as another included study, or other reasons’. Finally, seven non-random comparative studies16–22 were included in this meta-analysis. The included studies are shown in figure 1 (PRISMA flow diagram).

Study characteristics
The characteristics of the seven non-randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies are listed in table 1.We did not find an RCT study comparing the UTV and LTV as the site of the upper instrumented vertebra for the treatment of ASD. Cho et al17 and Kim et al20 separated the proximal instrumented vertebrae data into three groups (T9–T10, T11–T12 and L1–L2). For this study, the T11–T12 and L1–L2 groups were included in the LTV data set. There were 232 patients in the UTV group and 322 in the LTV group; more than 2 years of follow-up data were available for both groups.

Quality assessment
The methodological quality assessment of the seven included studies is summarised in table 2. Each of the seven studies clearly stated the aim of the study, and the participants were consecutive patients. The data in the study of O'Shaughnessy et al19 were collected prospectively, while in the other studies, the data were retrospectively collected. In the study of Kim et al,20 some patients did not finish the SRS score assessment; therefore, we assigned that study a score of ‘1’ for the ‘loss to follow-up less than 5%’ item. The scores ranged from 16 to 20, with a median value of 17.9. Publication bias was analysed using Begg's and Egger's tests; all of the p values were >0.05, and no publication bias was observed (see online supplementary table S2).

Clinical outcomes
The studies of O'Shaughnessy et al,19 Kim et al,20 Fujimori et al21 and Yagi et al16 reported SRS scores, including pain (−0.07, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.16, p>0.05), self-image (−0.07, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.15, p>0.05), function (−0.03, 95% CI −0.22 to 0.16, p>0.05), mental health (−0.30, 95% CI −0.63 to 0.02, p>0.05), subtotal (−0.10, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.09, p>0.05), satisfaction (0.13, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.40, p>0.05) and total scores (−0.03, 95% CI −0.23 to 0.18, p>0.05). No statistically significant differences were found between the UTV and LTV groups (figure 3). The I2 of the SRS self-image score was 2.4%, and the I2 of the SRS mental health score was 24.2%; all others were 0.0%.

The studies of O'Shaughnessy et al,19 Fujimori et al,21 Yagi et al16 and Du et al22 reported the ODI score results. The meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant difference between the UTV and LTV groups (WMD: 2.05, 95% CI −2.49 to 6.60), and no heterogeneity was observed (I2=0.0%, p=0.725; figure 4).

Radiographic outcomes
The meta-analysis of TK showed no significant difference between the UTV and LTV groups (WMD: 2.37, 95% CI 1.33 to 6.08), and no heterogeneity was observed (I2=0.0%, p=0.404; figure 5).

Figure 5 The meta-analysis of the radiographic outcomes showed no significant differences between the UTV and LTV groups in terms of TK, TLK, LL, PJK angle, C7SVA, and pelvic incidence.

No significant differences were found in the meta-analyses of TLK, LL, PJK angle, C7SVA or pelvic incidence; all were observed to have heterogeneity, with I2=70.2%, 46.2%, 81.8%, 89.8% and 40.5%, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the parameters revealed no significant changes in LL, PJK angle or pelvic incidence. The omission of Cho et al17 was found to significantly affect the C7SVA results (see online supplementary figure S1) and changed the WMD from −4.05 (95% CI −28.51 to 20.42) to −17.67 (95% CI −42.01 to 6.67; figure 5).

 Complications and revision
The meta-analyses of the total complications and total revisions revealed no significant difference between the UTV and LTV groups, with RRs of 0.89 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.29) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.14), respectively. The subgroup meta-analysis for revision surgery revealed that the UTV group had a lower risk of revision for PJK compared with the LTV group, with an RR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.90); no significant differences in pseudarthrosis or hardware implant failure for revision were found (RRs: 1.27 (95% CI 0.72 to 2.23) and 1.12 (95% CI 0.30 to 4.12), respectively; figure 6). Heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses of total revision and hardware implant failure for revision, with I2=50.3% and p=0.090 and I2=55.0% and p=0.109, respectively. The sensitivity analyses of these parameters showed no significant change when any one study was omitted (see online supplementary figure S1).

Discussion
Degenerative spinal deformity is typically observed in patients over 60 years of age.1
23–25 The symptoms of ASD vary from mild back pain without radiculopathy to severe back pain with radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication and even ambulatory intolerance.26 A positive radiographic test reveals coronal or sagittal imbalance or both, with or without spinal stenosis.27 Decreased LL and sagittal balance are the main causes of pain and functional loss.28
29 The aims of surgical treatment are decompression, pain relief and the re-establishment of coronal and sagittal balance.3
30–32

Posterior long fusion has been the primary surgical treatment for ASD;33 however, debate continues on the selection of the best proximal fused vertebra.10
34 Using the LTV as the site of the upper instrumented vertebra has been reported to cause a high prevalence of PJK,35–37 and some surgeons suggest using the UTV for a longer fusion with the aim of reducing the incidence of PJK and the need for revision.

Scheer et al18 reported that ASD patients undergoing posterior fixation extending into the upper thoracic region have better sagittal spino-pelvic alignment and a lower risk of revision surgery; however, O'Shaughnessy et al19 and Kim et al
20 have reported conflicting results. In this meta-analysis, we synthesised data on complications and revision surgery, and no significant differences were found between the UTV and LTV groups. A further subgroup analysis of the various reasons for revision surgery was performed and indicated that the UTV group had a significantly lower risk of revision because of PJK (figure 6). The T11–L2 segment has always been regarded as the junctional spinal segment, and the T1–T10 segment is supported by the true ribs, whereas the T11–T12 segment has floating ribs without costosternal articulation. The biomechanics differ significantly between the rigid thoracic spine and the flexible lumbar spine in the T11–L2 region. This region has been reported as having a high incidence of fractures and kyphosis.38
39 In addition, in the studies of Cho et al17 and O'Shaughnessy et al,19 the TLK was higher in the LTV group than in the UTV group; this finding supports the possibility that patients with postoperatively higher TLK are more likely to develop PJK and suggests that posterior fixation extending into the upper thoracic region could maintain sagittal alignment in the thoracolumbar region. Hyun et al40 reported that PJK patients had lower thoracolumbar muscularity and that lower thoracolumbar muscularity may induce higher TLK, resulting in a higher risk of PJK.

Although the UTV group had a decreased incidence of revision surgery for PJK, several deficiencies necessitated revisions. O'Shaughnessy et al19 reported that eight patients underwent revision surgery for the following reasons: PJK (one patient), pseudarthrosis (five patients) and pedicle fracture and iliac screw removal (two patients). Kim et al20 reported that 31 patients underwent revision surgery for PJK (5 patients) or pseudarthrosis (21 patients). Fujimori et al21 reported that 7 of 38 revision surgeries were for PJK and 14 of 31 were for pseudarthrosis. Pseudarthrosis is the cause of the highest proportion of revision surgeries, and the subgroup meta-analyses for revision surgery due to pseudarthrosis and hardware implant failure showed no difference in the RR between the UTV and LTV groups. This might explain why no significant difference was found in total revision surgery between the two groups.

Posterior fixation extending into the upper thoracic region results in a longer operative time and greater intraoperative blood loss. In this meta-analysis, the operative time of the UTV group was significantly longer than that of the LTV group (WMD: 0.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.39), and the UTV group had a greater estimated blood loss than did the LTV group. Most ASD patients are elderly,24
25 and the increased number of fused segments might increase the implant cost and lengthen postoperative recovery. Individual surgical endurance levels and life expectancy41 should be considered before making surgical decisions in these cases.

Another limitation is that there was no consistent definition of which vertebra constitutes UTV and which constitutes LTV. Clinically, the biomechanical transition region of the T11–L2 segment has always been regarded as the separating line by most surgeons; sites above this region were regarded as UTV, and those below it were considered LTV. To clarify to the readers how the UTV and LTV were determined in the studies included in this meta-analysis, the UTV and LTV designations for all of the included studies are listed in table 1. The differences in these designations may have introduced heterogeneity into the present meta-analysis.

Implications for future research and conclusions
Current evidence shows that long posterior fixation extending into the upper thoracic region provides better correction of TLK and reduces the incidence of revision surgery related to PJK. Increasing the operative level results in longer operative times and a higher estimated blood loss. The UTV and LTV groups had similar outcomes in terms of SRS scores, ODI scores, total complications and the total number of revision surgeries. This initial analysis indicates that extending fixation to the upper thoracic region is appropriate in patients who are likely to develop PJK following the initial scoliosis correction. Additional high-quality studies (RCTs with larger sample sizes) using the same surgical intervention protocol and follow-up time are needed to decrease heterogeneity and to confirm the reported effects.

THE RELATION OF THE KREBS CYCLE TO VIRAL SYNTHESIS
II. TEE EFFECt OF SODr0M FLUOROACETATE ON THE PROPAGATION OF
INFLUENZA VIRUS IN MICE*
BY W. W. ACKERMANN, PH.D.
Wn~ THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF ELAINE KLEmSCH~mT AND HILDA KURTZ
(From the Department of Epidemiology and Virus Laboratory, School of Public Health,
University o/Michigan, Ann Arbor)
(Received for publication, March 15, 1951)
It was concluded from previous investigations that certain chemical reac-
tions involved in the synthesis of influenza virus are coupled with some oxida-
tive reactions of the Krebs cycle (1).'In the experimental system used, the
propagation of influenza virus was found to be an aerobic process sensitive to
the suppression of respiration of the host tissue by controlled oxygen tension
or by chemical inhibitors of enzymes of the citric acid cycle. The interpretation
of these findings is somewhat restricted by the limitations which are always
associated with studies using excised tissues. Tentatively it may be suggested
that the functioning of these enzyme systems in the citric acid cycle is for the
production of energy necessary for the synthesis of viral protein. The inability
of the host-virus system to derive this energy from glycolysis may be due to
the absence of a mechanism whereby this energy-yielding process can be
coupled to the viral synthetic reactions. It is also possible that the energy avail-
able from this source is quantitatively inadequate because of the innate bio-
chemical nature of the host tissue or because of the conditions under which the
tissue is surviving. It is conceivable that in situ the rate of glycolysis of a tis-
sue with a blood supply may be quite different from that of the same tissue
surviving in Simms solution. Thus in the intact animal the requirement by the
virus for the enzyme systems of the Krebs cycle may or may not be specific.
Hence, it has seemed desirable to investigate in vivo the relation of the Krebs
cycle to viral synthesis.
The recent work of Buffa and Peters (2, 3), Potter and Busch (4), and Elliott
and Kalnitsky (5) provided an effective tool for the furtherance of this study.
By the use of sodium fluoroacetate, it is possible to inactivate the enzyme sys-
tems necessary for the oxidation of citric acid. Further, the actual time at
which the blocking of this metabolic step is operative can be determined. Under
the conditions of this alteration in metabolism, the propagation of influenza

virus in the lungs of mice has been studied. The details and results of this in-
vestigation are reported below.
Materials and Methods
Virus.--The PR8 strain of Type A influenza vires was used exclusively in this study.
Since its isolation from man, it has undergone 7 passages in ferrets, 593 passages in mice, and
127 passages in eggs.
lIice.--Inall experiments Swiss white mice (Webster strain) were used. They weighed from
10 to 18 gin. and were matched by weight for each particular experiment.
Virus Ti~ers.--Theamount of virus in the lungs of mice was estimated by determining the
infectious titer for eggs. For this purpose infected lungs were ground in a mortar with alundum
and diluted with beef infusion broth to yield a 10 per cent suspension. Tenfold serial dilutions
of this viral suspension were prepared and 4 eggs were inoculated with 0.1 ml. of each dilution.
The 50 per cent infectious titer was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (6).
The virus titer of allantoic fluid was also estimated by red cell agglutination using a pattern
method (7).
C#ri~Acid.--The citric acid content of lungs was determined by the pentabromoacetone
method as modified by Nateison eta/. (8). For this determination the tissue was prepared for
analysis as described by Potter and Busch (4).
Sodium Mono~oroace~ae.--The sodium monofluoroacetate used was prepared by Mon-
santo Chemical Co. and was free of fluoride ion. Solutions of suitable concentrations were
prepared in saline and adjusted to a pH of 7.4. In all instances the sodium fluoroacetate soin-
tions were prepared just prior to use and were administered intraperitoneally.
RESULTS
Effect of Sodium Fluoroacetate on Influenza Virus in Vitro.--
Various concentrations of sodium fluoroacetate were prepared in 0.15 x~ saline. These
preparations were added to equal volumes of allantoic fluid containing influenza virus. Control
preparations were made by mixing equal volumes of infected aUantoic fluid and physiological
salt solution. Some of the mixtures were incubated for 18 hours at 4 and others for 18 hours
at 37. At the end of the incubation period, the titers of infectivityin eggs and of hemagglufiuin
for chicken cells were determined. The maximum dose of fluoroacetate administered to mice
in the studies reported here was 0.08 rag. per mouse.
Concentrations of sodium fluoroacetate as great as 2.0 rag. per ml. at 37 
had no effect on the infectivity or hemagglutinin titer of the virus (Table I).
Sodium fluoroacetate is not virucidal in that it does not destroy influenza virus
on contact in ~tro.
Effect of Sodium Fluoroacetate on the Citric Acid Content of Mouse Lung in
Vi~o.--
Mice were injected intraperitoneally with sodium fluoroacetate in saline at a dosage of 4
rag. per kg. of body weight. In subsequent experiments it willbe demonstrated that this dosage
will produce a marked effect on the propagation of influenza virus in the lung. At various
intervals after the injection of fluoroacetate, groups of six mice were sacrificed. Citric acid
determinations were made on pooled samples of the lungs.
w. w. ACXm~ 637
The citric acid content of the lung had nearly doubled within M hour after
the administration of fluoroacetate and by 1 hour it had tripled. The maximum
increase detected (tenfold) had occurred by 8 hours and by 12 hours the citric

acid content had begun to decrease (Table II). From these data it was concluded
that citric acid oxidation could be blocked in the lung of the mouse by the intra-
peritoneal injection of 4 mg. per kg. of sodium fluoroacetate. Further, the max-
imum period of blocking achieved by one injection at this dosage was something
less than 12 hours. These results closely parallel those obtained by other workers
who studied the action of fluoroacetate in rats (4, 9, 10).
638 RELATI01~ OF KREBS CYCLE TO VIRAL SYNTtESIS
Effect of Sodium Fluoroacetate on the Propagation of In~uenza Virus in the
Mouse Lung.--
Five groups, each containing 6 mice, were inoculated intranasally with 0.05 ml. of influenza
virus, the infectivity titer of which for eggs was 103"5.15 minutes later they were injected
intraperitoneally with 0.25 ml. of sodium flnoroacetate in saline. The concentration of fluoro-
acetate was varied so that graded dosages were administered to different groups of mice.
24 hours after the intranasal inoculation, the mice were sacrificed and their lungs were removed.
The infectivity titer for eggs was determined on the pooled lungs from each group of mice.
The titers of the lungs of the mice treated with fluoroacetate were compared with those of mice
treated with saline.
Marked inhibition of virus propagation was observed with a dosage of 2 mg.
per kg. of fluoroacetate. Maximum inhibition was achieved with 3 to 5 mg./K

in which case the lowest infectivity titer of the lungs for eggs was 103.s while
that of the control was 10e.* (Table III). Thus, the intraperitoneal administra-
tion of sublethal concentrations of sodium fluoroacetate which are known to
inhibit oxidation of citrate was found to inhibit the propagation of influenza
virus in the mouse lung.
Effect of a Single Injection of Fluoroacetate on the Growth Curve of Influenza
Virus.-
To determine the duration of the effect of a single injection of fluoroacetate on the propaga-
tion of influenza virus, the growth curve of the virus was determined in the lungs of mice
which were treated with saline and compared with that obtained in mice treated with fluoro-
acetate. Ten groups, each containing 6 mice, were inoculated with 0.05 ml. of influenza virus
which had an infectivity titer for eggs of 103"5.15 minutes later 5 groups of mice were injected
intraperitoneally with saline and 5 groups were injected similarly with 4.3 mg. per kg. of
sodium fluoroacetate. At each 12 hour interval thereafter, one group of mice treated with
saline and one group treated with fluoroaeetate were sacrificed. The titers of pooled samples
of these mouse lungs were determined in eggs.
W. W. AC~m 639
The greatest difference was at the end of 12 hours in which case the titers
of virus from animals treated with saline differed from those treated with
fluoroacetate by nearly 3 logs. Differences were observed at 12, 24, and 48
hours after injection of the inhibitor (Table IV). However, the effect was found
to grow small with time until at 48 hours the difference in infectivity titers was
only 0.7 log.
Effect of the Time of Administration of Sodium Fluoroacetate.
If the administration of fluoroacetate inhibits oxidation of citrate and interrupts the
Krebs cyclewhich is supplying energy for viral synthesis, it should be possible to halt viral
multiplication at any point of the growth curve by the injection of that inhibitor. To test for
this experimentally, 5 groups containing 6 mice each were inoculated intranasallywith 0.05
ml. of influenza virus with a titer of 103.5for eggs.Two groups were injected intraperitoneaUy

with saline a few minutes after the inoculation of virus. One of these groups was sacrificed
after 12 hours and the other at 24 hours. The infectivitytiter in eggsof virus from each group
of mouse lungs was determined. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th groups of animals were injected
with 4.3 rag. per kg. of sodium fluoroacetate at 0, 6, and 12 hours, respectively. 24 hours
after the inoculation of virus, these animals were also sacrificedand the infectivity titers of
virus in their lungs were determined.
From Table V it is seen that regardless of when the inhibitor is administered,
there is inhibition of viral multiplication. Further, the titers of lungs of the
control mice at 12 and 24 hours were 1@.0 and 106.7, respectively, while the
titer at 24 hours of the lungs of mice treated with inhibitor 12 hours after viral
inoculation was 103.7. This indicates that the inhibition produced by one in-
jection of fluoroacetate was effective for approximately 12 hours.
Effect of the Concentration of the Viral Inoculum.--If the action of fluoro-
acetate is to render the chemical environment unsuitable for virus propagation,
640 RELATION OF KREBS CYCLE TO VIRAL SYI~Ttt~;SIS
then inhibition should occur to some extent irrespective of the amount of virus
present. The data of Table V indicate this to be true since inhibition can be
produced with fluoroacetate initially or after the virus has multiplied for 6 or
12 hours.

A further test was carried out by injecting mice with inocula of different concentrations
and testing the mice for inhibition of virus multiplication by fluoroacetate. Four groups of
12 mice each, were injected intranasally with 0.05 ml. of influenza virus of titers 106"5, 105"s,
104"5, and 103"5,respectively. One-half of each group of mice was treated 15 minutes later
with 4 rag. per kg. of sodium fluoroacetate. The second half of each group was treated with
saline. At the end of 24 hours the 8 groups of mice were sacrificed and the virus content of
their lungs was titered in eggs.
W. W. ACKERMANN 641
With each concentration of inoculum used, the titer of the lungs of the ani-
mals treated with fluoroacetate was 2 to 4 logs lower than the corresponding
control group treated with saline (Table VI). It is evident that the degree of
inhibition observed during a 24 hour period is greater as the concentration of
virus inoculum is decreased.
DISCUSSION
When fluoroacetate is administered to animals, the enzyme system neces-
sary for the oxidation of citrate is inactivated, while the enzymes necessary for
synthesis of citrate appear to be relatively unaffected (5, 9-11). The continued
synthesis of citrate without its further metabolism leads to the accumulation
of this metabolite in large quantities in many tissues of the animal (4, 3). It
has been suggested that the rise in citrate concentration is primarily an ex-
pression of the metabolism of the individual organ. This conclusion is supported
by the fact that the citrate contents of the individual organs of the animals
treated with sodium fluoroacetate differ widely from one another and from the
blood level (2, 9, 10).
It has been reported that at relatively high concentrations, fluoroacetate
will inhibit the oxidation of fatty acids which takes place in the presence of
washed suspensions of rabbit liver probably owing to the binding of magnesium
ions into a magnesium-fluoroacetate complex (12). The significance of this
finding in vivo is as yet unknown. It is difficult to determine if the action of any
inhibitor in dvo is specific. However, the problem of specificity does not alter
the action of the inhibitor in the citric acid cycle.
By the administration of sublethal doses of fluoroacetate which were found
to increase the concentration of citrate in the lungs of mice, it is possible to
demonstrate a blocking of the citric acid cycle in those organs. Since these reac-
tions are essential for viral synthesis as indicated by prior experiments in
vitro (1), the propagation of influenza virus should be inhibited under these
conditions in the lung. Experimentally this anticipated inhibition of viral prop-
agation by fluoroacetate was verified (Tables II, IV, V, and VI).
The experiments described here are confined to one strain of influenza virus;
however, it might be anticipated that fluoroacetate will act against a relatively
broad spectrum of viruses. Firstly, the inhibitor blocks citrate metabolism not
only in the lung but in the brain and spinal cord of mice. Secondly, it would
seem that an energy source for endergonic synthetic reactions, e.g. the forma-
tion of nucleoprotein, is an essential requirement for the propagation of virus
and may be one phase of viral synthesis which several host-virus systems have
in common.
At present, data are not available to describe the effect of multiple injections
of fluoroacetate on the course of a viral infection in mice. Indeed it is question-
able whether the use of this inhibitor alone will be of value in chemotherapy.
642 RELATION OF KREBS CYCLE TO VIRAL SYNTHESIS
The real worth of these experiments lies in pointing up one site in the host
metabolism where some drug might act usefully. It is conceivable that an
inhibitor can be found which will act at this site and in addition will possess
other desirable properties which are essential for a useful drug. These data
indicate that it is possible to achieve inhibition of viral synthesis in the intact
mouse by the partial suppression of the Krebs cycle.
S13~'~rARy
A further study has been made of the relationship of reactions of the Krebs
cycle to the propagation of influenza virus. By the administration of sublethal
doses of sodium fluoroacetate which were found to increase the concentration
of citrate in the mouse lung, it was possible to demonstrate a blocking of the
citric acid cycle in that organ. Further, the intraperitoneal administration of
these concentrations of fluoroacetate was found to inhibit markedly the prop-
agation of influenza, Type A, virus in the lungs of mice.
The inhibition was observed when the fluoroacetate was administered 15
minutes, 6 hours, or 12 hours after the mice were inoculated with virus. This
effect was also demonstrable when the concentration of the viral inoculum was
varied over a range of virus titers from 103.5to 106.5.
Sodium fluoroacetate was found to have no effect in vitro on the infectivity
or hemagglutinating property of the virus.
The significance of these findings with regard to chemotherapy and to the
mechanism of viral synthesis is described.

Background: Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) is a common clinical problem and often creates a diagnostic dilemma in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this subset of patients, if the cause of fever remains un-diagnosed, it may increase the morbidity and mortality. In this study, we used 18 F FDG PET CT scan in CKD patients presenting with PUO to localize the hidden focus of infection.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study from August 2010 to December 2012, total n = 10 patients (6 M and 4 F), mean age 45 years, range 31-60 years, known CKD patients on renal replacement therapy, 9 patients on hemodialysis and one on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) all clinically labeled as case of PUO and subsequently referred for 18 F-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET CT) from Department of Nephrology. Following, standard guidelines for patient preparation and data acquisition, PET CT performed in all patients on Biograph 06, PET CT scanner, PET CT images reviewed and reported jointly by radiologist and nuclear medicine physician.

Results: In all 10 patients, PET CT scan detected one or multiple metabolically active lesions in body. These were involving lymph nodes, bones, spleen, adrenal gland, lung and intestinal lesions in descending order. Histo-pathological diagnosis was possible in 8/10 patients, from one of the approachable lymph node or bone lesion. In remaining two patients, no histo-pathological evaluation performed, as in one patient CT lung of PET CT scan clearly revealed milliary tuberculosis and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes which were difficult to sample by FNAC and in other one patient, a metabolically active lesion detected in ilio-caecal region, for further characterization of this lesion, patients refused to co-operate for any invasive procedure. All patients, treated appropriate antibiotics or anti tubercular drugs and responded clinically to the given treatment.

Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET CT survey of body highly sensitive test, can provide high yield in localization of hidden infection in body, and reduce the morbidity and mortality in affected patients.

PET-NO-02: Improved diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET CT in the evaluation of diabetic foot complications: A prospective comparison study with three phase bone scan GS Shagos, Shanmuga Sundaram Palaniswamy, Padma Subramanyam, Ajith Kumar Varma1

Departments of Nuclear Medicine and PET CT, and 1Podiatry, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi, Kerala, India

Objectives: We attempted to compare the diagnostic accuracies of three phase bone scan (TPBS) and FDG PET-CT (FDG PET) in the evaluation of complicated diabetic foot.

Materials and Methods: 36 diabetic patients, (M: F, 27:09, age range 44-73 years [mean age 58.7]),with clinical suspicion of pedal osteomyelitis were prospectively investigated between July 2010 and 2012. TPBS (15 mci MDP IV) performed followed by FDG PET (5 mci IV) within 05 days in all patients. Findings were assessed by two nuclear medicine physicians. Interpretation was based on intensity, extent, pattern of MDP and FDG uptake (SUV). CT correlation was used for localisation. Bone/soft tissue culture and sensitivity was considered as the gold standard for diagnostic correlation. All patients followed up for 6 months.

Results: In the study Gp, n = 36, osteomyelitis: cellulitis were 19:17 by FDG PET and 27:9 for TPBS respectively. Of the 36 patients, culture and sensitivity were available for 23 patients. 13 patients whose culture was not available were not included in calculating sensitivity and specificity. In diagnosing osteomyelitis, TP: TN:FP: FN were 14:5:2:2 by FDG PET-CT- and 13:02:05:03 by TPBS respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of FDG PET were 87.5%, 71%, 87.5% and 71% and for TPBS were 81.25%, 28.5%, 72% and 40% respectively. Though MDP uptake was noted in bones in many patients in TPBS, many of them showed FDG uptake restricted to soft tissue than in bones showing high sensitivity, but low specificity of TPBS.

Conclusion: FDG PET-CT has higher specificity and positive predictive value than TPBS in diagnosing osteomyelitis in complicated diabetic foot. By excluding osteomyelitis, FDG PET due to its higher negative predictive value can help to spare patients from more aggressive surgical management. FDG PET-CT alone can be considered in the place of TPBS in complicated diabetic foot evaluation.

Objective: 2-deoxy-2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F- FDG PET/CT) has now become an established imaging tool in oncology. It is now emerging in the field of infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in investigating patients with pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO).

Materials and Methods: After proper patient preparation and informed consent, a total of 36 referred patients (24 men, 12 women, with age range 21-63 years) underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT for evaluation of pyrexia of unknown origin. All examinations were performed using dedicated LSO PET-CT scanner in 3-D mode, 60 min after i.v. injection of 370 MBq of 18F-FDG. No IV contrast was given. Reconstruction of the acquired data was performed so as to obtain fused PET-CT images in transaxial, coronal and sagittal views.

Results: Twenty three out of 36 patients showed foci of increased FDG uptake in the whole body image thus helping in diagnosis and localising the active focus of disease. Remaining 13 patients did not show any area of abnormal FDG uptake. The sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET/CT for identifying the cause of PUO was 63.88%.

Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET/CT in addition to contribution towards the diagnosis also helped in localization of disease. Our results suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT may be used as an initial non-invasive diagnostic modality for assessment of patients with pyrexia of unknown origin.

PET-NO-04: Delayed imaging of myocardial fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with CAD BP Tiwari, P Kand, R Ranade

Radiation Medicine Centre (BARC), Tata Memorial Centre Annexe, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

Objective: Cardiac FDG PET study is conducted to evaluate hibernating status in perfusion defects at rest evident on myocardial perfusion study. FDG uptake of myocardium is affected by various factors with inadequate results obtained in myocardial FDG PET study. We studied myocardial FDG uptake at different times after injection to investigate the usefulness of delayed imaging.

Materials and Methods: Twenty patients (18 male +2 female, age range 27-71 years) with coronary artery disease showing perfusion defect at rest on myocardial perfusion imaging were referred for cardiac FDG PET. Patients underwent myocardial FDG PET imaging as usual at 1 h. Further additional imaging was performed at 2 h and 4 h post FDG injection. We calculated FDG activity concentration in defective myocardial segments (as per myocardial perfusion imaging) as well as in whole heart for the images taken at different intervals each time by SUVmax in ROI. An ROI was drawn over liver region and SUVmax was noted for background. Mean value of SUVmax obtained for diabetic (9) and non-diabetic (11) patients were grouped together for comparison.

Results: In non-diabetic patients mean of SUVmax was 7.26 (3.46-12.03), 9.43 (5.04-12.13) and 10.43 (4.4-15.57) at 1 h, 2 h and 4 h respectively for regions showing defect. Global SUVmax in these patients at these time intervals was 11.79 (5.45-14.83), 14.14 (9.1-16.2) and 14.76 (5.67-17.26) respectively. In diabetic group only global SUVmax could be calculated for one patient. In other 3 diabetic patients, regional defect could not be identified on 1 h image. Mean SUVmax of defective regions in 5 patients was 5.52 (4.35-7.34) at 1 h. Mean SUVMax for 8 patients in defective regions at 2 h and 4 h was 5.81 (2.24-8.7) and 6.86 (2.55-10.94) respectively. Global SUVmax for diabetic patients was found to be 7.13 (3.45-10.93), 9.81 (4.75- 17.32) and 12.05 (5.7-22.25) at 1 h, 2 h and 4 h respectively. There was no significant change in liver SUVmax in all cases.

Conclusion: Progressive increase in FDG concentration is noted in the myocardium resulting in delayed PET showed higher SUVmax values at 4 h in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Delayed studies in myocardial FDG PET may provide incremental value over conventional protocol in assessment of hibernating myocardium in perfusion defects noted at rest.

PET-NO-05: 18F-FDG whole body activity retention studies using external dose rate measurement data in patients undergoing positron emission tomography-computed tomography studies Swasti Dixit, Deepti Rathod, Sujith Rai, Anand Zade, B Rajashekharrao, A Velumani

Nuclear Healthcare Ltd. 4/1A, Sector 23, Kopar Khairane,Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

Objective:
18F-FDG PET-CT scan has found wide applications in oncology, neurology and cardiology. Though introduced in clinical practice for over a decade, the data on the whole body retention of 18F-FDG at different time intervals is limited. This study was performed to assess the whole body 18F-FDG retention using the 1 m external dose rates data measured at different time intervals.

Materials and Methods: This prospective study was performed on 21 consecutive patients referred for whole body 18F-FDG PET-CT scan. 5 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG was injected intravenously. The dose rate at a distance of 1 m was recorded both anteriorly and posteriorly, using G.M. Survey meter (S.E. International, Model: Radiation alert inspector). The readings were recorded immediately after the injection, prior to imaging (45-60 min post-injection) and 90-105 min after the injection. Decay corrected retention of the 18F- FDG was computed from the geometric mean of the readings obtained at these time intervals.

Results: The 1 m dose rate measured at 0, 45-60 and 90-105 min post- injection ranged from 1.98 to 4.70, 1.05-2.69 and 0.65-1.28 mR/h respectively with a mean (± SD) of 3.11 (±0.73), 1.69 (±0.42), 0.94 (±0.25) and median of 3.2, 1.69 and 0.90 mR/h respectively. The mean (±SD) percentage whole body retention of 18F-FDG calculated from the dose rate data at 45-60 min and 90-105 min post-injection was observed to be 72.71 (±9.2) % and 53.9 (±10.03)% respectively.

Conclusion: The whole body retention data of 18F-FDG would be useful for modeling effective dose calculations to the patient, comforters and members of the public.

PET-NO-06: Development of 68Ga labeled fatty acids for potential use in cardiac metabolic imaging Akanksha Jindal, Anupam Mathur1, Haladhar D Sarma2, Usha Pandey, Ashutosh Dash

Objective: [11C]-palmitate is used clinically for myocardial PET imaging. However, the short half-life (20 min) of [11C] and complicated radiolabeling protocol produces low yields of the final radiopharmaceutical. Therefore, we aimed to prepare 68Ga-labeled fatty acids as substitutes for [11C]-palmitate, since 68Ga with a half-life of 67.71 min, is available from a 68Ge/68Ga generator and is known to form high yielding complexes with convenient chemistry.

Materials and Methods: The desired fatty acid conjugates were synthesized by reaction of p-SCN-benzyl NOTA with the ω-amino group of 11-aminoundecanoic acid and 12-aminododecanoic acid, respectively. Both the derivatives were radiolabeled with 68Ga in acetate buffer. Characterisation of the complexes as well as determination of radiochemical yields was done by HPLC. Bioevaluation studies were carried out in Swiss mice to assess their potential for myocardial imaging.

Results: Both the 68Ga labeled fatty acid complexes could be prepared in >90% yields. Biodistribution studies in Swiss mice showed reasonable myocardial uptake at 2 min for both the derivatives (7 ± 2.75% ID/g for 11-carbon fatty acid-NOTA conjugate and 6 ± 2.12% ID/g for 12-carbon fatty acid-NOTA conjugate). Initial uptake was followed by rapid clearance of the activity from the target organ over time, as expected for long chain fatty acids. The complexes cleared rapidly from the other organs via the hepatic route.

Conclusions: The significant heart uptake of the 68Ga labeled fatty acid complexes and their rapid clearance from non-target organs makes them potential candidates for dynamic myocardial imaging. Further studies are underway to establish their clinical utility.

PET-NO-07: Development of estradiol based probe for imaging ER+ receptor using PET K Ganesh Kadiyala, Anupriya Adhikari, Kanchan Chauhan, M Thirumal, AK Mishra, Anupama Datta

Division of Cyclotron and Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, DRDO, Delhi, India

Aim: Positron emission tomography is one of most common non-invasive technique in the field of molecular imaging. Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of diagnosed cancer in women and is the second leading cause of death in women. ER+ concentration is high in cancer cells when compared to healthy cells, this is one of the early indication of cancer. One way to determine the ER+ of cells would be to image breast tumors, using positron emission tomography (PET). Estradiol is the most active endogenous estrogen, and its derivatives are used by millions of women in hormone replacement therapy. E2CF3 was synthesized and the conditions for the labelling with 18F were optimized. The ligand was finally labelled with 18F to evaluate its potential for ER+ tumor imaging through Positron Emission Tomography technique.

Materials and Methods: Synthesis of desired probe was performed using estrogen derivative, 17α-ethynylestradiol as precursor. The 17α-ethynyl-estradiol was derivatized by click chemistry to give 15-(1-(2-aminoethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-14-methyl-7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17-decahydro-6H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-2,15-diol (Est-NH2). The obtained Est-NH2 was converted to the ligand E2CF3 through a multistep reaction. The conditions to radiolabel it with 18F through nucleophilic reaction approach were optimized. Post cold labelling the compound was characterized with spectroscopic techniques.

Results: Synthesized compounds were characterized by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Radiolabeling efficiency with 18F was found to be >84% and serum stability indicated that 18F remained bound to E2CF3 upto 4 h.

Conclusion: The desired compound was synthesized through click reaction in high yield (>90%) and initial studies suggested that the E2CF3 can be further explored for ER+ targeted PET imaging for breast cancer.

Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization is still an actual problem in our transfusion practice. In 2011, in addition to the regular ABO/D blood group typing, phenotyping for Rh (C, c, E, e) and Kell antigens was introduced for blood donors and patients undergoing blood transfusion. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of the extended RBC typing and donor/recipient matching on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization.

METHODS:
A retrospective comparative study was conducted by reviewing RBC request records for about 36,000 patients transfused with RBC in the period from 2013 to 2015 in comparison to the similar study conducted on 47,000 transfused patients in the period from 2005 to 2008. Pre-transfusion serologic testing data were retrieved for analysis. Blood samples with positive antibody screening and positive cross-match were further subjected to antibody identification. All the tests were performed using column agglutination technique (CAT) with ID-cards and reagents from DiaMed in both studies.

RESULTS:
Irregular RBC alloantibodies were detected in 116 (0.32%) out of 36,000 transfused patients. Multiple transfusions (15.8 units/patient) were given to 450 patients from which 79 (17.5%) had RBC allontibodies. The incidence of RBC alloimmunisation in the rest of the 35,550 transfused patients from which 37 had RBC alloantibodies was 0.10%. A total of 117 alloantibodies were identified in 96 out of the 116 patients with irregular RBC antibodies. Their specificity was as fallows: anti-E (25.6%), -C (6.0%), -c (8.5%), -e (0.85%), -Cw (5.1%), -K (12.8%), -Fya (10.2%), -Fyb (2.5%), -Jka (7.7%), -Jkb (2.5%), -M (9.4%), -S (1.7%), -s (0.85%), -Lua (1.7%), -Leb (3.4%) and anti-Leb (0.85%). Multiple antibodies were identified in 22 of the transfused patients out of which 15 (68.2%) received multiple transfusions. Anti-E was the most common antibody found in more of the 50% of the multiple antibody cases.

CONCLUSIONS:
The overall incidence of RBC alloimmunization in transfused patients decreased from 0.51% which was the estimated incidence for the period before the introduction of the extended RBC typing (2005-2008) to 0.32% (2013-2015). This is due to the decreased incidence of RBC alloimmunization in the multiply transfused patients from 33.9% to 17.5% respectively. The current frequency of anti-E (25.6%) and -K (12.8%) antibodies in transfused patients are significantly lower than their previous estimated frequencies of 30.4% and 24.0% respectively, as well as the overall frequency of RBC antibodies to Rh+Kell antigens which decreased from 72.4% to 53.8%. Extended donor-recipient matching for C, c, E, e and Kell antigens has proved a beneficial effect on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization in multiply transfused patients.

ABO/RH typingRBC alloantibodiesRBC transfusion
==== Body
Introduction
Red blood cell alloimmunization results from the genetic red blood cell antigen disparity between donor and recipient or from mother and fetus. The surface of the red blood cell (RBC) is coated with antigens (sugars and proteins) that are integrally linked to membrane proteins or lipids. The clinical relevance of these antigens for blood component transfusion and tissue/organ transplantation lies in the ability of these surface molecules to initiate an immune response [1].

The way the immune system reacts depends on several factors. The immune response to carbohydrate antigens is usually thymus independent. Multivalent antigens directly stimulate B cells to synthesise antibodies without the aid of helper T cells resulting in the majority of cases in the production of IgM antibodies. Individuals lacking a particular carbohydrate blood group antigen on their red cells can have ‘naturally occurring’ IgM antibodies, which are most probably stimulated by cross-reacting antigens present in the environment, such as on gut bacteria. The most important carbohydrate antigens for blood transfusion practice are the A- and B-antigens. Normal individuals who lack either the A or B antigen make IgM B or A antibodies, respectively. Since IgM antibodies are complement-binding, these antibodies can cause immediate and severe intravascular hemolysis after transfusion of incompatible red cells, which can lead to serious or fatal complications [2].

The discovery of the AB0 blood group system, by the Austrian pathologist Karl Landsteiner [3] and the introduction of the AB0 blood grouping test for selected donors by Ottenberg [4] in 1911 greatly reduced the fatalities associated with blood transfusion in the early days of transfusion therapy. Despite the ABO matching, hemolytic transfusion reactions were reported in 1921 by Unger [5], and additional tests were recommended to exclude the possibility of a recipient’s serum agglutinating the donor’s red cells due to the presence of non-ABO antibodies, now known as irregular alloantibodies. These alloantibodies are directed against the numerous other blood group antigens which reside on membrane proteins and comprise polymorphic determinants dependent primarily on amino acid sequence. These protein antigens can stimulate a thymus-dependent immune response, and the resulting IgG antibodies can cause extravascular clearance of antigen-positive cells. These IgG antibodies may also cross the placenta, resulting in hemolytic disease of the newborn.

Currently, 35 blood group systems and 342 antigens are recognised by the Working Party committee on terminology for red cell surface antigens of the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). The most important irregular red blood cell alloantibodies in daily transfusion practice, in terms of clinical significance and frequency of occurrence, are directed towards the RH (anti-D, -C, -E, -c and -e), KEL (anti-K), FY (anti-Fya and -Fyb), JK (anti-Jka and -Jkb) and the MNS (anti-M, -S and -s) blood group systems [6]. Of these, the D-antigen is the most immunogenic, resulting in more than 80% of immunocompetent D negative persons becoming allo immunised after a transfusion of D-positive erythrocytes [7]. This has resulted in the prophylactic matching of red cell transfusions for the D-status. Such routine is not sufficient to prevent other RBC antibodies, for which we rely on serologic screening before transfusion.

Retrospective studies in the general population reported antibody frequencies after transfusion of less than 1 to 3 percent. However, in multi-transfused patients alloimmunization occurs from 10-38% and up to 60-70% of patients [8-11].

Whether the recipient’s immune system will produce RBC antibodies depends on genetic and acquired patient-related factors, antigen frequency in the population, dose and number of expositions (transfusions) and the immunogenicity of the RBC antigen as it is shown in Table 1 [12].

Clinical manifestations of RBC antibodies are acute intravascular hemolytic transfusion reactions (rarely a consequence of alloimmunization and almost always caused by ABO antibodies), delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) (hemolysis caused by RBC alloantibodies at least 24 hours posttransfusion) and hemolytic disease in newborns (mother’s alloimmunization against fetal antigens, most often resulting from previous pregnancies).

Nowadays, after 70 years of transfusion practice, RBC alloimmunization is still an actual problem in our pre-transfusion testing. It is a cause for a delay in transfusion treatment of the alloimmunized patients because antigen-negative RBC must be provided which can be difficult in a patient with rare and multiple alloantibodies.

In 2011, in addition to the regular ABO/D blood group typing, routine phenotyping for Rh (C, c, E, e) and Kell antigens was introduced in blood donors and patients undergoing a blood transfusion. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of the extended RBC typing and donor/recipient matching on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization.

We compared the sex, number of transfusions and specificity of the revealed alloantibodies as well as the overall incidence of alloimmunization in the two groups of transfused patients in the above mentioned periods, i.e., the period before and after the introduction of routine extended Rh (C, c, E, e) and Kell antigen typing.

Results
In the period from 2005 to 2008 irregular red cell antibodies were detected in 53 (0.11%) out of 46,459 transfused patients and in 188 (33.9%) out of 554 multiply transfused patients. The overall incidence rate of immunisation due to RBC transfusion in the total of 47,013 transfused patients was 0.51%, and the total number of patients with positive antibody screening was 241 (Table 2).

In the period from 2013 to 2015 irregular red cell antibodies were detected in 37 (0.10%) out of 35,550 transfused patients and in 79 (17.5%) out of 450 multiply transfused patients. The overall incidence rate of immunisation due to RBC transfusion in the total of 36,000 transfused patients was 0.32%, and the total number of patients with positive antibody screening was 116 (Table 2).

The incidence of alloimmunization in the multiply transfused patients decreased from 33.9% to 17.5% which lead to the decrease of the overall incidence of RBC alloimmunization in transfused patients from 0.51% to 0.32% respectively. However, irregular RBC antibodies were significantly more frequent in the multiply transfused patients in comparison to transfused patients in both periods (p < 0.05).

According to the sex, there was no difference between the number of male and female transfused patients in the two observed periods, i.e. the period before (2005-2008) and the period after the introduction of extended RBC typing (2013-2015). Significant difference in the occurrence of immunization between male 60 (32.4%) and female 128 (67.7%) multiply transfused patients was observed in the period from 2005 to 2008, as it was in the period from 2013 to 2015 being 31 (39.3%) male and 48 (60.7%) female patients (p<0.05).

There was no significant difference between the two groups of multiply transfused patients according to the number of transfusions (Table 2).

Also, there was no significant difference in the rate of alloimmunization between the two groups of multiply transfused patients according to the diagnosis as shown in Table 3.

In 126 (52.3%) out of 241 transfused patients with irregular antibodies, 138 clinically significant antibodies were identified in the period from 2005-to 2008 in comparison to 117 alloantibodies which were identified in 96 (82%) out of the 116 transfused patients in the period from 2013 to 2015. Specificity of the identified antibodies is shown in Table 4.

Multiple antibodies were identified in 9 (7.1%) out of 126 patients with specific alloantibodies from which 7 (77.7 %) were multiply transfused in the period from 2005 to 2008. In comparison to that, 22 (18.9%) out of 96 patients had multiple antibodies from which 15 (68.2%) received multiple transfusions. The current occurrence of multiple alloantibodies (68.2%) was lower in a patient with multiple transfusions in comparison to the period before extended RBC typing was introduced. Anti-E was the most common antibody found in more of the 50% of the multiple antibody cases.

The risk of alloimmunization to anti-E and anti-K is 297.47 times greater (RR=68.21 r<0.05) in multiply transfused patients in comparison to transfused patients. The frequency of RBC antibodies to Rh+Kell antigens decreased from 100 (72.4%) to 63 (53.8%) identified alloantibodies which are mostly due to the decreased frequency of E and K antibodies.

The current frequency of E which is 30 (25.6%) antibodies and for K which is 15 (12.8%) antibodies in transfused patients is significantly lower (χ2 = 12.7, p < 0.01) than their previous (2005-2008) estimated frequencies of 42 (30.4%) antibodies and 33 (24.0%) antibodies respectively.

Discussion
Despite the relatively high frequency of RBC alloimmunization, clinical manifestations of hemolytic transfusion reactions are rare (approximately 0.05% of patients transfused) due to the regular ABO/D matching and serologic patient/donor cross-matching [12]. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to ABO mismatched RBC transfusions almost always occur as a clerical error (misidentification of the patient/blood sample or incorrect blood component transfused) [13].

Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) can occur if the alloantibody titer drops below detectable levels (which is nowadays rarely the case with the column agglutination technique used for the compatibility testing), or in very rare cases of primary immunisation after an initial transfusion. Based on recent UK haemovigilance data from Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT), a total of 1681 cases were reported in 2014. Of these cases, there were 151 (8.9%) cases with RBC alloantibodies and 46 (2.7%) cases with HTRs from which 18 acute and 28 delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions [14]. HTRs and related mortality have been reported to occur at approximately 1 in 76,000, and 1 in 1.8 million units transfused, respectively [15, 16]. The risk of death from a DHTR is approximately 1 fatality per 3.85 million units (1 per 1.15 million units in patients who have received transfusions) [12].

Nowadays, we see RBC alloimmunization more as a problem of the laboratory to provide compatible blood for transfusion because this process is time-consuming and often causes a delay in transfusion treatment. The most frequent alloantibodies identified in transfused patients and different groups of chronically transfused patients (sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia as well as in nonhematologic patients) are within the Rh and Kell system [10, 11, 17, 18]. These findings suggest that it is vice to perform extended typing for chronically transfused patients at least for Rh (C, c, E, e) and Kell antigens before the initial RBC transfusion. For this purpose, it is also rational to have already typed RBC in the blood supply.

Sickle cell disease patients are at particular risk of alloimmunization, which can be reduced by red cell phenotyping before the first transfusion followed by routine matching for at least the Rh and Kell groups [19]. This has been challenged by a recent study that showed no difference in alloimmunization rates between centres in the United States that provided closer antigen matching compared to those who did not [20].

However, most investigators agree that the extended RBC typing (beyond the routine ABO/D typing) has a beneficial effect on the incidence of alloimmunization in thalassemia major patients [18, 21]. It has been shown that nonhematooncologic alloimmunized patients are high antibody responders, with a more than 20 times increased risk to form antibodies compared to first-time alloimmunization risk. If extended matching for C, c, E, K, Fy(a), and Jk(a) antigens in the future is considered, this group should be taken into account [22]. According to the data on the estimated frequency of clinically significant red blood cell antigens, there is no significant difference between the multiply transfused patients and the blood donors in the absence of race differences [11]. Individuals from ethnic minority groups have an increased risk of alloimmunization from transfusion because notable differences exist in the frequency of blood cell antigens between races. Efforts to increase the blood supply from minority donors are essential to reduce the frequency of alloimmunization in these groups [12].

However, total prevention of RBC alloimmunization and HTRs is unrealistic, because current immunohematological methods of testing are not sensitive enough to detect all RBC antigen and antibodies. In the early 2000s the EU BloodGen group was established with the aim of improving patient safety and blood transfusion compatibility through validation and standardisation of molecular genotyping approaches and to prove its superiority over currently applied serological testing [23]. BLOODchip is an integrated circuit that determines the main allelic variants of blood groups and platelet antigens by analysing 128 genetic polymorphisms. It is used to prevent potential transfusion reactions in those patients for whom conventional serologic tests are insufficient. It is still too early to determine whether proposals to minimise RBC alloimmunization through large-scale molecular RBC typing for all patients would be more efficient since the genotyping is no longer regarded as being more costly than serology [24]. Speaking of RBC alloimmunization, blood banks and immunohematology laboratories can not influence the demographic structure of the patients, neither the number of transfusions. What they can do is to choose and to optimise the method and the extent of RBC antigen typing and donor/recipient matching are providing more timely the most compatible blood for transfusion.

In conclusion, there was no significant difference according to the sex, diagnosis and number of transfusions, except for the incidence of alloimmunization between the group of transfused patients in the period before and the patients transfused after the introduction of extended RBC typing. Although, the incidence of alloimmunization did not change (0.11% vs. 0.10%) over the time in the patients who were not multiply transfused it was not the case for the multiply transfused patients. The incidence of alloimmunization in the multiply transfused patients significantly decreased from 33.9% to 17.5% which lead to the decrease of the overall incidence of RBC alloimmunization in transfused patients from 0.51% to 0.32% respectively.

The current frequency of anti-E (25.6%) and -K (12.8%) antibodies in transfused patients are significantly lower than their previous estimated frequencies of 30.4% and 24.0% respectively, as well as the overall frequency of RBC antibodies to Rh+Kell antigens which decreased from 72.4% to 53.8%. We believe that the extended donor-recipient matching for C, c, E, e and Kell antigens has a beneficial effect on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization especially for multi transfused patients. Currently, approximately 30% of the available RBC units are typed for CEce/K within the corresponding ABO/D blood group. Our goal is to reach the number of 50% of Rh, and Kell typed RBC in our blood supply which would be sufficient to meet the needs for antigen negative RBC for most of the alloimmunized patients at any time. At this point and with the currently employed serologic methods there is no rational for routine donor/patient typing beyond ABO, Rh, and Kell systems in our transfusion practice.

As rodent models demonstrate that T cells play an important role in limiting WNV infection, and strong T cell responses to WNV have been observed in humans, we postulated that inadequate antiviral T cell immunity was involved in neurologic sequelae and the more severe outcomes associated with age. We previously reported the discovery of six HLA-A*0201 restricted WNV peptide epitopes, with the dominant T cell targets in naturally infected individuals being SVG9 (Env) and SLF9 (NS4b). Here, memory phenotype and polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses to these dominant epitopes were assessed in 40 WNV seropositive patients displaying diverse clinical symptoms. The patients' PBMC were stained with HLA-I multimers loaded with the SVG9 and SLF9 epitopes and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. WNV-specific CD8+ T cells were found in peripheral blood several months post infection. The number of WNV-specific T cells in older individuals was the same, if not greater, than in younger members of the cohort. WNV-specific T cells were predominantly monofunctional for CD107a, MIP-1β, TNFα, IL-2, or IFNγ. When CD8+ T cell responses were stratified by disease severity, an increased number of terminally differentiated, memory phenotype (CD45RA+ CD27− CCR7− CD57+) T cells were detected in patients suffering from viral neuroinvasion. In conclusion, T cells of a terminally differentiated/cytolytic profile are associated with neuroinvasion and, regardless of age, monofunctional T cells persist following infection. These data provide the first indication that particular CD8+ T cell phenotypes are associated with disease outcome following WNV infection.

Introduction
West Nile virus (WNV) was first reported in the eastern United States in 1999 and has since spread westward through the entire North American continent. Reported WNV cases peaked at about 10,000 in 2003 and WNV continues to represent a considerable public health threat. Among infected individuals, almost 50% report neurologic symptoms due to encephalitis or meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/surv&controlCaseCount09_detailed.htm). Furthermore, rates of WNV infection are expected to increase if global temperatures rise [1]. At this time there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection; intensive supportive therapy is directed toward the complications of brain infections, with anti-inflammatory medications, intravenous fluids, and intensive medical monitoring applied to severe cases. There is no prophylactic vaccine.

Most primary WNV infections are asymptomatic or exhibit a mild, flu-like illness that lasts no more than a few days. Successful resolution of primary WNV infection is associated with development of adaptive immunity to the virus. Some individuals undergo neurologic complications that can arise long after the acute phase of the infection has been resolved [2]. In addition, recent evidence suggests long term persistence of WNV, in a small but significant number of infected humans [3]. Given that MHC class I restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play an important role in controlling WNV infection in animal models [4], [5], [6], we reasoned that the severe CNS sequelae of WNV infection could be related to a lack of T cell immune control of the virus infection.

The objective of this study was to delineate whether CD8+ T cell immunity to WNV was related to neuroinvasive disease. This included assessment of memory T cell phenotypes, i.e., CD45RA (a spliced isoform of the leukocyte common antigen), CD27 (a member of the TNF receptor superfamily), CD57 (an indicator of T cells with limited proliferation potential) and CCR7 (lymph node homing receptor), and polyfunctional T cell activity, i.e., production of more than one immune mediator that are known to be involved in control of other viral infections [7], [8]. While no consensus has been reached as to what a “protective” T cell phenotype might be, a polyfunctional population of CD8+ T memory cells with a naïve-like phenotype (CD45RA+, CD27+, CCR7−) has been reported following vaccination with another flavivirus, yellow fever virus, in addition to Vaccinia and HIV infections [7], [8], [9]. Thus, we hypothesized that a lack of polyfunctional T cells with an effector memory phenotype would be related to neuroinvasive WNV infection. Our findings indicate that memory CD8+ T cells in persons with neuroinvasive disease were memory T cells are skewed towards a terminally differentiated, memory phenotype that was predominately monofunctional.

Results
Long term memory T cells specific for SVG9 and SLF9 are found at a relatively high frequency
Previously, we comparatively analyzed thousands of peptide ligands eluted from the HLA class I of infected cells, discovering six WNV-encoded, HLA-A*0201 restricted, peptide epitopes [10], [11]. Two of the six epitopes identified in these studies, SVG9 and SLF9, generated the most IFN-γ producing T cells in WNV seropositive donors. The other four epitopes generated comparatively little IFN-γ, possibly because these ligands were recognized by low frequency T cells or because these T cells do not make IFN-γ upon stimulation. To have a better understanding of the frequency of CD8+ T cells specific for the six HLA-A*0201 WNV peptides, we generated peptide-MHC multimers loaded with each of the peptides described (Table 1).

Our results demonstrated that the immunodominance of SVG9 and SLF9 that we previously showed by production of IFN-γ in vitro was also evidenced by direct staining of uncultured CD8+ T cells with multimers specific for SVG9 and SLF9. T cells specific for these two WNV epitopes and the control, EBV epitope GLC9 were detected in the PBMC of the WNV-infected but not uninfected participants (Figure 1A). Memory T cells specific for immunodominant epitope SVG9 were recognized with a median frequency of 347/106 CD3+ CD8+ cells (range, 15 - 8,529). Cells that were specific for nonstructural protein NS4b epitope SLF9 were recognized with a median frequency of 370/106 CD3+ CD8+ cells (range 76 - 4,144), similar to SVG9. By comparison, the well characterized HLA-A*0201 restricted immunodominant EBV BMLF-1 (GLC9) epitope was recognized with a frequency of 467/106 CD3+ CD8+ T cells (range 19 - 53,129) in the WNV positive group. Thus, after acute WNV infection, populations of peripheral memory CD8+ T cells specific for SVG9 and SLF9 were maintained at frequencies similar to T cells specific for an immunodominant lytic epitope of the persistent herpesvirus EBV.

Log10 frequency of p-MHC multimer positive events per 106 CD3+/CD8+ cells from WNV seropositive and WNV seronegative subjects are shown for (A) dominant epitopes and (B) non dominant WNV epitopes. All comparisons were made using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-hoc test. In all cases, lines represent mean values.

In contrast to SVG9 and SLF9, the frequency of T cells specific for the four subdominant WNV epitopes (RLD10, SLT9, YTM9 and ATW9) did not differ between WNV seropositive and seronegative persons (p>0.05) (Figure 1B). These data indicate that the lack of a T cell response in the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay corresponds to a dearth of circulating T cells with T cell receptors specific for these subdominant WNV/A*0201 peptides. To confirm that T cells do recognize these four viral peptides, albeit at a frequency below the multimer staining-assay detection limit in unstimulated PBMC, T cell lines were successfully generated to all of these epitopes. Thus, memory T cells specific for subdominant WNV epitopes exist at a frequency below the detection limit of both IFN-γ ELISPOT and p-MHC staining.

Relationship between age and WNV memory T cell frequency
Advanced age is a risk factor for WNV disease severity [12]. We therefore examined correlations between age and SVG9/SLF9-specific T cell frequencies and found a significant positive correlation (p<0.01) of age and SVG9 p-MHC multimer-positive cell frequency (Figure 2A). When the cohort was stratified by age, there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in SVG9-specific T cells in the 41–59 and ≥60 age groups compared to subjects who were <40 years of age at the time of infection (Figure 2C). Conversely, there was no significant correlation between SLF9 p-MHC multimer positive cell frequency and age (Figure 2B) and no differences in SLF9 frequency among age groups (Figure 2D). In addition, there was no significant linear correlation with age and EBV frequency, suggesting this is WNV SVG9 specific. These data demonstrate age-related changes in WNV-specific, memory CD8+ T cell frequencies, and that these changes are epitope specific. Moreover, the frequency of T cells specific for the most dominant WNV/A*0201 epitope increased with age.

Log10 frequency of p-MHC multimer positive cells specific for SVG9 (A) and (B) SLF9 WNV epitopes vs age. The linear regression model is shown with the 95% confidence bands. Log10 frequency of SVG9 (C) and SLF9 (D) p-MHC multimer positive cells were divided into three age groups: subjects ≤40, 41–59, and ≥60 at time of infection. For (C) data did not fit a normal distribution so a Kruskal- Wallis ANOVA was used with Dunn's method of comparative analysis and medians are shown.

In contrast to the association of age with increases in T cells specific for SVG9, subjects with neuroinvasive disease did not exhibit an elevated frequency of SVG9 or SLF9 specific memory T cells (data not shown). However it should be noted that in our cohort there was not a significant age-related association with neuroinvasive disease; 14% for subjects <40 years of age and 36% for those aged 60 and over (p = 0.61). Thus, the increase in SVG9 specific T cells with age observed in our cohort was independent of disease severity.

Long term memory surface phenotypes of p-MHC reactive cells in WNV seropositive subjects
Little information is available pertaining to the surface phenotype of long-term memory, CD8+ T cells to WNV. A recent study showed that equal numbers of CD45RA+/− CD27− (effector phenotype) and CD45RA− CD27+ (memory phenotype) WNV-specific CD8+ T cells are found one month after infection [13]. This study utilized antigenic stimulation, a method that changes surface phenotype. Here, we investigated pre-antigenic stimulation ex vivo T cell surface phenotypes using p-MHC multimers. For clarity we report four previously defined primary memory T cell subsets: T effector memory (Tem), T central memory (Tcm), T double positive effector memory (Tdpem) and T effector memory RA+ (TemRA). These subsets and their corresponding phenotypes are shown in Table 2. EBV epitope GLC9 from the immediate early, lytic protein BMLF1, is included as a point of reference.

10.1371/journal.pone.0015343.t002Table 2 Memory T cells subsets and their surface phenotype.
	CD45RA	CD27	CCR7	CD57	
Tcm	−	+	+	−	
Tem	−	+	−	−	
Tdpem	+	+	−	−	
TemRA	+	−	−	+	
The surface phenotypes of memory T cells specific for SVG9 and SLF9 contained significant numbers of both Tem and Tdpem cells (Figure 3). For SVG9, Tdpem were most prominent, and few Tcm cells were found. An unexpected observation was that SVG9 specific T cells displaying a terminally differentiated TemRA phenotype were significantly over represented (Figure 3A, bottom right panel). This is unexpected because TemRA cells are more common during chronic infections such as human cytomegalovirus [14], while WNV causes an acute, nonpersistent infection, although this notion was challenged by recently described evidence [2], [3], [15]. In summary, T cells specific for SVG9 and SLF9 are largely Tem and Tdpem and a significant population of SVG9 specific T cells are of the TemRA phenotype (Figure 3B).

In all other cases a one way ANOVA with a Tukey post-hoc test was used and means are shown. (B) The size of each cell represents the median percentage of the prevalent memory phenotypes for each of the epitopes examined in (A).

WNV specific memory T cell phenotype differs with age and disease severity
Because our cohort had no age-related association with disease severity, we independently examined relationships between WNV-specific CD8+ T cell phenotypes, disease severity, and age. First we tested T cell phenotype profiles between subjects who had neuroinvasive disease and those who did not. For SLF9 specific cells, the Tdpem subset was overrepresented in subjects who did not develop neuroinvasive disease (Figure 4A, bottom left panel). A similar pattern was observed for SVG9, although the mean percentages were not statistically different. Interestingly, TemRA cells specific for SVG9 were more common in the neuroinvasive than in the non-neuroinvasive subjects. This increase in TemRA T cells in neuroinvasive subjects was specific to SVG9 as no difference was observed in the percentage of cells specific for subdominant epitope SLF9 (Figure 4A, bottom right panel). Finally, the Tem and Tcm median percentages were the same in both groups for SVG9 and SLF9. Epitope-specific TemRA cells are associated with WNV neuroinvasive disease while the Tdpem subset corresponds to a lack of neuroinvasive symptoms (Figure 4B).

(A) Memory phenotypes of antigen experienced T cells from donors with or without neuroinvasive symptoms are shown, based on expression of CD27, CD45RA, CCR7, CD57 as defined in Table 2.

For data of a non-normal distribution, lines represent median values and p values are from a Mann-Whitney test. (B) The size of each cell represents the median percentage of the prevalent memory phenotypes for each of the two clinical conditions.

Although age did not correspond to disease severity in our cohort, we nevertheless investigated CD8+ T cell phenotypes among defined age groups. When T cell phenotypes were stratified by age, both the SVG9 and SLF9 specific Tdpem subtype (CD45RA+ CD27+ CCR7− CD57−) differed with age (Figure 5). The Tdpem phenotype was significantly overrepresented in subjects less than 40 years of age as compared to the older age groups (Figure 5A). It is worth noting that, as with the frequency data, there was no significant (p>0.05) gender differences in phenotype (data not shown). Together these data demonstrate that the surface phenotype of WNV memory cells vary with disease severity, age, and epitope specificity (Figure 5B).

CD8+ T responses are primarily monofunctional with a high cytolytic potential in neuroinvasive disease
Having identified phenotypes unique to donors with neuroinvasive symptoms, we next investigated the functional capacity SVG9 and SLF9 specific T cells in these patients. The stimulation of PBMC with SVG9 and SLF9 generated responding T cells that were primarily monofunctional (51.1% for SVG9 and 71.0% for SLF9) (Figure 6). Simultaneous expression of all five functions was evident in the minority of donors for both the SVG9 and the SLF9 epitopes (3/10 in either cohort, data not shown). T cells were primarily monofunctional and there was no difference in the polyfunctional capacity of T cells in donors with either neuroinvasive or nonneuroinvasive symptoms.

10.1371/journal.pone.0015343.g006Figure 6 Responses of CD8+ cells stimulated with the SGV9 or SLF9 WNV peptide epitopes are predominantly monofunctional.
PBMC from subjects with or without neuroinvasive disease were stimulated with the immunodominant SVG9 or subdominant SLF9 WNV peptide epitopes and functional responses were evaluated by multi-color flow cytometry. Percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing the markers shown were input in the SPICE software for display. Pies represent the distribution of responses by function for each group according to the color scheme below. Bars represent the level of response for each individual of the 32 different marker combinations. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p<0.05) by Wilcoxon signed -rank test.

The neuroinvasive cohort did demonstrate a significant increase in the cytolytic associated marker CD107a (Figure 6 top panel). Again, WNV epitope specificity revealed itself as SVG9 but not SLF9 specific T cells exhibited an augmented expression of CD107a (Figure 7). This CD107a association with disease progression is consistent with the TemRA surface phenotyping data; SVG9 specific TemRA were overrepresented in neuroinvasive donors and produced CD107a upon antigenic stimulation.

PBMC from donors with or without neuroinvasive disease were stimulated with the immunodominant SVG9 or subdominant SLF9 peptide WNV epitopes and functional responses were evaluated as described. Percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing the cytotoxicity surrogate marker CD107a were added for each of the 32 combinations shown in Figure 5 using SPICE software. Pies represent the distribution of CD107a positive (red) and negative (green) for the two epitopes. Bars represent the interquartile range (25% –75%) of the CD107a response for the two cohorts. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for the two antigens.

Discussion
Understanding the phenotype and functional status of T cells during a successful immune response, as well as during disease progression, is needed for the design of anti-viral immune interventions. The characterization of T cells following vaccination (YFV, vacccinia) or during chronic viral infection (HIV, EBV) indicates that particular T cell phenotypes and functional status mediate infection, yet T cell responsiveness varies from vaccine-to-vaccine and from virus-to-virus [14]. The blueprint continues to emerge in regards to the T cell response(s) that a successful vaccine or immune therapy must elicit. As T cell responses play an important role in the resolution of WNV infections, in this study we characterized WNV-specific memory CD8+ T cells in patients that resolve their infection, in patients with neuroinvasive disease, and stratified by age. Our data show that disease severity, age, and epitope specificity are associated with changes in memory T cell phenotype and frequency.

Our most immediate objective was to examine T cell frequencies: Immune senescence is receiving considerable attention as a risk factor during acute WNV infections in that increasing age corresponds to greater disease severity [12]. During influenza virus infections [16], [17] the frequency of virus-specific T cells decreases with age, and we posited that this would occur with WNV as well. Such was not the case, and the frequency of T cells specific for the immunodominant SVG9 epitope actually increased with age. These data demonstrate that CD8+ T cell immunity to WNV can increase as one grows older and that a dearth of WNV specific CTL mediated immunity does not correspond to disease progression.

Although T cell frequencies for the dominant WNV/A*0201 epitope increased with age, a previous study [11] found that the number of IFN-γ secreting T cells specific for SVG9 & SLF9 did not increase as patients aged. The data presented here resolve this discrepancy between total T cell numbers and IFN-γ secretion. First, the ICS data presented here reiterate that the frequency of IFN-γ producing SVG9 memory T cells does not increase with age (Figure S3A and B). However, when the activation markers CD107a, TNFα, IL2, and MIP1β are factored into the analysis, the number of SVG9 responsive T cells significantly increases with age (Figure S3C and D). These data demonstrate that the number of T cells responding to the immunodominant SVG9 epitope increase with age and that these T cells are functionally diverse.

Disease outcome was found to be independent of T cell frequency, and the next logical step was to characterize the phenotype of responding T cells. Four T cell categories were tested (Tdpem, TemRA, Tcm, Tem), and the largest proportion of WNV specific T cells exhibited a Tdpem phenotype. This memory CD8+ T cell subset was recently identified as the predominant subset following vaccination with YFV17D [7], suggesting that Tdpem correspond with protection from flaviviral infection. In addition to the Tdpem phenotype, Tem cells were observed for both SVG9 and SLF9, and for the SVG9 epitope a substantial number of TemRA cells were identified following infection. The Tdpem memory T cell surface phenotype is consistent with that of YFV17D vaccination and may represent a paradigm of protection for flaviviral infections.

Neuroinvasive diseases including encephalitis, meningitis and meningoencephalitis, represent the most severe conditions following WNV infection, and the relationship of T cell phenotypes and neuroinvasive outcomes was examined. Most interesting was the observation that significantly more CD45RA was expressed on by the SVG9-specific CD8+ T memory cells of donors with neurological involvement. These T cells expressed CD57, the an indicator of low proliferation potential, and lacked expression of CD27, confirming their terminally differentiated TemRA phenotype [18]. This increase in the frequency of T effector memory CD45RA+ cells following neuroinvasive infections is the first indication that changes in T cell immunity are directly associated with WNV disease severity.

TemRA cells are most commonly observed during chronic infections where antigen persists after a primary infection with pathogens such as HIV and herpesviruses [14]. Unlike these viruses, WNV infection is classified as an acute infection where sterile immunity is achieved. However, this perception may be evolving as WNV has been shown to persist in individuals with neurologic symptoms and given the observation that symptomatic WNV infections result in long term chronic symptoms. In addition, WNV RNA has been isolated from the urine of convalescent patients years after the primary infection [3]. TemRA cells may therefore indicate that WNV antigen remains following infection. Alternatively, an elevation in CD57 expressing TemRA cells in those with neuroinvasive disease may be a vestige of a strong proliferative response during the primary acute infection. Longitudinal studies that assess changes in virus-specific immunity and that test for residual virus will help to elucidate the cause and effect relationship of neuroinvation and TemRA cells.

Tdpem cells that follow YFV vaccination have a polyfunctional phenotype in that each cell produces >4 different immune mediators in addition to degranulation [7], [8]. Polyfunctional T cells have also been shown to be advantageous for the control of HIV, and we next characterized the functional status of WNV-specific T cells. We found that the majority of infected donors have WNV specific T cells that are monofunctional. In comparison to T cell functionality following vaccination with the YFV vaccine, differences in polyfunctional responses could be due to a difference in natural infection with wild-type WNV as compared to vaccination with live attenuated 17D YFV. Alternatively, differences in the class I HLA/flaviviral peptide complexes tested for WNV and YFV T cell recognition might contribute to differences in the measurement of polyfunctional T cells – each of the six WNV peptides tested here behaved differently.

In summary, we used six high-confidence WNV peptide epitopes to dissect memory T cells that remain following viral infection. T cells specific for two immunodominant WNV epitopes were detectable well after the infection was resolved and the frequency of these WNV specific T cells remained unchanged and, in some cases, increased with age; age and disease severity do not coincide with a dearth of immune reactivity. Surface phenotyping demonstrates that the majority of memory T cells have a Tdpem phenotype consistent with YFV17D vaccination, although T cells that respond to a natural WNV infection are predominatly monofuntional. In regards to neuroinvasive pathologies, T cells with a terminally differentiated phenotype represent a post-infection marker for neuroinvasive pathologies, implicating persistence of WNV antigens. Finally, age and neuroinvasive changes associated with WNV infection were specific to the dominant SVG9/A*0201 epitope complex and did not extend to the 5 other WNV epitopes presented by HLA-A*0201. Future studies of the acute immune responses that give rise to these memory T cell subsets are needed, and these studies may require both dominant and subdominant epitopes in order to identify immune response that coincide with disease progression.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Peripheral blood was collected from consenting subjects diagnosed with WNV in heparinized tubes in accordance with a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh IRB and the Research Ethics Board at McMaster University. For all donors, written, informed consent was obtained before enrolment into the study in accordance with a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh IRB and the Research Board at McMaster University.

Patients and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) preparation
Subjects were enrolled in the study following presentation of symptoms of WNV infection at local primary care clinics and detection of serum IgM by public health laboratories. HLA genotypes were determined using DNA sequence analysis at Pure Transplant Solutions (Oklahoma City, OK). Forty subjects expressing HLA A*0201 allele were selected for phenotype screening of WNV specific memory CD8+ T cells, using previously defined HLA A*0201 class I WNV specific multimers (Table 1). Memory responses were measured from peripheral blood samples collected 6–7 months post symptom onset. Subject data are summarized in Table 3. Of the forty patients, 10 were diagnosed with encephalitis according to CDC guidelines. A control group of 9 WNV seronegative, HLA A*0201 subjects and 2 WNV seronegative HLA A*0201 negative subjects from Pittsburgh Central Blood Bank were also included in the study. PBMCs were isolated from the blood samples by centrifugation on Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia) and cryopreserved in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 12.5% human serum albumin (Sigma) and 10% DMSO (Invitrogen).

p-MHC multimer staining and detection
To determine the frequency of peptide-specific T cells in PBMC, cells were thawed on the same day of the assays, let recover for 2 hours at 37°C, then treated with 100 µg/ml of DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich), and washed twice in monoclonal wash buffer (HBSS with 0.01% NaN3, 1% FBS). After recovery, PBMC were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with individual WNV specific p-MHC multimers (ProImmune). Afterwards, cells were washed and then stained for 20 min at 4°C with monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface antigens: CD3-APC-H7 and CD8 PerCP-Cy5.5 for T cell lineage; CD57-FITC, CD45RA- PE-Cy7 (all from BD Biosciences), CCR7-PE (R and D Systems) and CD27 PE-Cy5 (Beckman-Coulter) for T cell memory phenotyping; CD4, CD14, CD16 and CD19 were used to exclude cells binding nonspecifically to the p-MHC multimers (dump channel) and were labeled either with PE-TexasRed (Beckman-Coulter) or with V-450 (BD Biosciences); APC fluorotag (ProImmune) for p-MHC multimer identification. Cells were then washed and resuspended in stabilizing fixative (BD Biosciences) and analyzed on a FACS LSRII (BD Biosciences) within 24 hours. Color compensation was set up with every assay using mouse Ig binding beads (BD Biosciences). PBMC from HLA A*0201 WNV seronegative subjects were treated as described above and used as negative controls. HLA A*0201 restricted BMLF-1 EBV multimer (GLCTLVAML) was used as positive control. At least 100,000 events were collected from each subject. Data were analyzed with DIVA software (BD).

Gating strategy and validation of WNV specific p-MHC multimers
To identify and enumerate epitope-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, we used peptide HLA *0201 multimeric complexes specific for six individual HLA A*0201-restricted WNV epitopes previously discovered by mass spectroscopy and validated by functional testing (Table 1) in a WNV infected cohort (Table 3) [10]. In Figure S1, the polychromatic (8 color) multiparameter gating strategy used to identify WNV specific CD8+ T cells is described. CD4/CD14/CD16/CD19 positive cells were excluded (dump channel) to select T cells of CD8 lineage (CD3+/CD8+). Within this population the phenotypic distribution of memory markers expressed by WNV p-MHC specific T cells (i.e. CD45RA, CD27, CCR7 and CD57) was determined. Gate positions for CD45RA, CD27, CCR7 and CD57 were set for each donor based on the phenotype distribution of pMHC multimer negative CD8+ CD3+ cells. CD8+ T cells specific for the different A*0201/WNV peptides were thus enumerated and characterized in PBMC of WNV seropositive donors. To account for background in subsequent analyses, the frequency of CD8+ cells reacting with only the APC fluorotag was subtracted from the epitope specific frequencies for each donor. Thus, donor whose p-MHC cell frequency was below the APC fluorotag background frequency (negative group) were separated from those who were above (positive group). This resulted in 34/40 (85%), 34/40 (85%) and 33/40 (82.5%) of subjects positive for SVG9, SLF9 and EBV, respectively, in the positive group. The positive group was used for subsequent phenotypic analysis. To further ensure phenotypic analysis was not affected by background we grouped the samples by donors having frequencies below 3X FMO and by donors above 3X FMO. We then compared the phenotype distributions between these two groups. We found no significant difference p>0.05 in the median percentages with any phenotype (data not shown).

Evaluation of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality
Cryopreserved PBMC from a total of 20 WNV infected donors (10 non-neuroinvasive and 10 neuroinvasive) were thawed for intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and analyzed by flow cytometry in order to measure the expression of the following immune mediators: IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, MIP-1β, and CD107a. Cells were rested in media overnight at 37°C and then washed. Aliquots of 106cells were then co-cultured with the immunodominant WNV Env peptide (SVG9, 10 µg/ml), anti-CD107a mAb FITC (BD Bioscience), GolgiStop and GolgiPlug (BD Bioscience) in a 96-well plate. The negative control was medium only and the positive control was cells stimulated with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) (5 µg/ml, Sigma). Plates were incubated at 37°C for 6 h and then stained for viability with the amine-binding dye Aqua (Invitrogen) and then washed. Cells were then simultaneously stained with anti-CD3 mAb PE-Cy7 (BD Bioscience), anti-CD8 mAb PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Bioscience), anti-CD4 mAb, anti-CD14 and anti-CD19 (all V450 conjugated; “dump channel”; BD Pharmingen), incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT), and then washed. The plates were washed with cold buffer, treated with BD FACS Permeabilizing Solution 2 (200 µl/well), incubated for 10 minutes at RT, and then washed with 200 µl/well of the cold buffer. The following mAb were then added: anti-TNFα PE-Cy7 (BD Bioscience), anti-MIP-1β PE (BD Pharmingen), anti-IL2 APC (5 µL, Biolegend), and anti-IFNγ AF700 (BD Bioscience). The plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min, washed with 150 µl/well of cold buffer, and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were analyzed using a LSR-II 12-color flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Polyfunctional responses to peptide or mitogenic stimuli were subtracted from cultures incubated with medium alone and assessed using the SPICE program (Version 4.3, Mario Roederer, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH). The complete gating strategy for these samples is detailed in Figure S2.

Statistical analysis
The frequency of antigen specific, p-MHC reactive T cells does not follow a normal istribution [19] and for this reason all subsequent statistical analysis on memory cells was performed on a normalized distribution of log transformed data. Multimer positive cells were divided by total CD3+CD8+ cells. This number was then represented as events per million (multiplied by 10e6) rather than a percent (multiplied by 100). The frequency was then log transformed and reported as log 10 p-MHC positive cells per million CD8+ CD3+ cells. Donors with no response in any assay were removed from analysis. In all cases of regression analysis, a linear regression model was used. R squared values were considered significant when p<0.01. All data were tested for a normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p>0.05. Data considered to be normally distributed were analyzed using either an unpaired t-test or a one way ANOVA with a tukey post-hoc test and these data were summarized as means. When data were not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney or a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn's method was used and these data were summarized as medians. For polyfunctional responses, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test used. All data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism software v4.01.

Polychromatic (8 color) staining of HLA-A*0201 restricted p-MHC multimer WNV specific CD8 + T cells from representative subject IDSA30. The gating strategy firstly identifies “singlets” by plotting forward scatter area versus forward scatter height. The singlet gate is further depleted of events identified by CD4/CD14/CD16/CD19 (dump channel) to reduce non-specific background staining. Gated CD3+ events are then plotted against forward scatter to identify T cells. Following this, T cells of CD8 lineage are plotted against APC labeled multimers and finally multimer positive events are characterized for the phenotypic distribution of memory markers (CD45RA/CD57/CCR7/CD27) within the multimer positive population.

It is of great importance to know when these three key events occur, because doing so helps recommendation systems, online marketing, and containment of rumors.

First, popularity evolution has high variation and can follow various patterns, so how can we identify “burst”, “peak”, and “fade” in different patterns of popularity evolution? Second, these events usually occur in a very short time, so how can we accurately yet promptly predict them? In this paper we address these two issues. To handle the first one, we use a simple moving average to smooth variation, and then a universal method is presented for different patterns to identify the key events in popularity evolution. To deal with the second one, we extract different types of features that may have an impact on the key events, and then a correlation analysis is conducted in the feature selection step to remove irrelevant and redundant features. The remaining features are used to train a machine learning model. The feature selection step improves prediction accuracy, and in order to emphasize prediction promptness, we design a new evaluation metric which considers both accuracy and promptness to evaluate our prediction task. Experimental and comparative results show the superiority of our prediction solution.

Introduction
Thanks to the ubiquity of social media sites, massive amounts of online information (e.g. news, videos, pictures, hashtags, etc.) are constantly being produced. Because of many factors, including user interests, real world events, and celebrity involvement, online information exhibits variable popularity evolution [1–3]. Some pieces of online information gain little popularity at first, but burst suddenly, and then fade slowly. Some reach peaks very soon but die an early death. Others experience more variable behaviors [4] (but still approximately follow a rising and falling evolution), as shown in Fig 1. Therefore, the popularity of online information can generally be viewed as a kind of organism that undergoes three key events during its evolution: “burst”, “peak”, and “fade”.

10.1371/journal.pone.0168749.g001Fig 1 The popularity evolution of Twitter hashtags exhibits rich temporal variation.
In (a) and (b), the popularity evolution experiences one huge spike, and the popularity bursts and peaks suddenly. In (c) and (d), the popularity evolution generally follows a rising and falling pattern despite several spikes.

Just like growth, maturation, and aging are defining events in the life of an organism, we think that “burst”, “peak”, and “fade” are representative events in the popularity evolution of online information. If we can predict these events, we can take a full view of the whole popularity evolution and determine the overall popularity trend [5] of online information. In this paper, we propose the prediction of the burst, peak, and fade events in popularity evolution as a new prediction task.

Our work is mainly inspired by the studies of popularity evolution prediction, concerning such fields as volume prediction [6–9] and burst prediction [10–13]. Since most existing work concentrates on predicting future popularity volume (e.g. predicting the value of popularity one day later), this paper considers the problem from another angle: predicting when popularity bursts, peaks, and fades. Recent work has focused on predicting popularity will burst or not [14] or when popularity will burst [13]. To capture the whole evolution, “peak”, and “fade” are equally as important as “burst”. We simultaneously study “burst”, “peak”, and “fade” and view them as a representative summary of popularity evolution.

This paper presents a rigorous study that rises to the two challenges in this task.

Challenge 1. The popularity of online information exhibits rich temporal variation and follows various evolution patterns. How can we identify these key events in these circumstances? By using a simple moving average (SMA) we smooth temporal variation to extract the trending line of popularity evolution. Burst, peak, and fade events are then defined from the trend line of popularity evolution.

Challenge 2. As we can see in Fig 1, popularity usually bursts and peaks very quickly, which makes predictions more difficult. This requires us to emphasize not only the accuracy but also the promptness of a prediction. On a data set containing approximately 3 million Twitter hashtags and 40 million users, this paper presents a simple solution which consists of the steps of feature extraction, feature selection, and model training by using the selected features. Different types of features, including temporal features, social features, hashtag string features, and topological features, are extracted from hashtags. Features that are highly related with the burst, peak, and fade events are selected through correlation analysis. This step helps to improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results show our solution outperforms other solutions in terms of prediction accuracy. Finally, we construct a new evaluation metric that takes not only accuracy but also promptness into account, and show how to use this new metric to evaluate predictions made at different time points.

We mention the following scenarios where the prediction of burst, peak, and fade events can be used. According to when popularity will burst and fade, online advertisers [15] can decide when to place and remove their advertisements. Caching systems can also decide when to cache and remove webpages. Furthermore, a rumor [16, 17] can be stopped in time if we predict its bursting or peaking time.

The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we put forth a new and challenging prediction task—predicting the “burst, peak, and fade” key events. Second, this paper provides a solution and new evaluation metric for this task. Third, this paper finds that the key events are highly correlated with each other after a logarithmic transformation, and that one of the temporal features (the amount of time it takes popularity to reach a certain level once evolution begins) has the most effect on the key events.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces background and related work. Section 3 presents problem definitions and the characteristics of the three events. A solution is described in Section 4. How to evaluate this prediction task is discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.

Background and Related Work
Since the emergence of social media sites, a great deal of research interest has arisen in the area of online information popularity [18–20]. Some studies [6, 21, 22] refer to popularity as the attention online information receives from people. Researchers have tried to model and predict how the amount of attention will be devoted over time to a given piece of online information (that is, popularity evolution). Our work relates to the two directions of popularity evolution: popularity evolution patterns and popularity evolution prediction [23, 24].

Popularity Evolution Pattern
Researchers have found several patterns to characterize how popularity rises and falls during its evolution.

Yang and Leskovec [2] proposed the K-Spectral Centroid (K-SC) clustering algorithm by adopting a time series similarity metric. The algorithm uncovered six popularity evolution patterns according to the rise and fall of popularity. The biggest cluster had a quick rise followed by a monotonic decay and the rate of decay was slightly lower than that of rise. Figueriedo et al. [25] utilized different YouTube data sets: videos on the top lists and videos protected by copyright to analyze how the popularity of individual videos evolved. Copyright protected videos tend to get most of their popularity much earlier during their evolution, often exhibiting a popularity growth characterized by a viral epidemic-like propagation process. In contrast, videos on the top lists tend to experience sudden significant peaks of popularity.

The above work characterizes popularity evolution from a qualitative perspective, while other work has done so from a quantitative perspective. Crane and Sornette [1] used a self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson process to model the popularity evolution of YouTube videos and showed that the popularity of YouTube videos follows the evolution pattern of a power-law rise and power-law fall. Matsubara et al. [4] stated that real data followed the popularity evolution pattern of an exponential rise and power-law fall and their model (the SpikeM model) which obeyed this pattern fitted real data very well. Yu et al. [26] propose a representation named “phase” to capture the salient rising or falling trend of popularity, which extends the work of Crane and Sornette.

The above studies are the starting point for this paper. Since all these studies demonstrate that the popularity of online information generally experiences a rising and falling evolution, we view the burst, peak, and fade events as a representative summary of popularity evolution.

Popularity Evolution Prediction
Considerable work has been conducted on predicting future popularity volume. Szabo and Huberman [6] presented a regression prediction model based on the strong linear correlation between the logarithmically transformed popularity of YouTube videos at previous and future times. To predict the bursting and peaking popularity volume, Li et al. [27] developed a popularity prediction solution (SoVP) which recorded viewing-sharing relationships among users to calculate the influence of underlying diffusion structures. He et al. [8] considered two types of sources in the comments of online information: timestamps for obtaining a temporal factor, and usernames for mining potential social influence to model comments as a time-aware bipartite graph to predict future popularity. To predict the final popularity volume of Twitter tweets, Zhao et al. [9] proposed a self-exciting point process model to capture “rich get richer” phenomenon in popularity evolution.

The above work focuses on popularity volume, whereas other studies have focused on whether popularity will burst or not and when popularity will burst. Kong et al. [14] present a binary classification task: will popularity burst in the near feature? They found that the SVM model achieves the best performance in their task. Wang et al. [13] predict when a burst will come. Due to the diverse time spans of popularity evolution, they formulate their problem as a classification problem to predict in which time window burst will appear.

In contrast to most existing work, we consider the three events together and place emphasis on predicting when popularity undergoes these three key events, rather than on future popularity volume.

Preliminaries
This section first introduces the basic concepts in this paper and discusses how to identify burst, peak, and fade events in popularity evolution. This section then presents our data set and finally discusses the characteristics of the three events.

Problem Definitions
Popularity. By the popularity of a piece of online information we refer to the amount of attention this information receives, such as, the number of views that a video receives, or the number of users discussing a hashtag.

Popularity Evolution. Note that most pieces of online information undergo both active and inactive periods [28]. We use the same method as that in [28] to distinguish between both periods: we consider a piece of information inactive if it gains no popularity for 24 hours. To simplify the problem, we shorten popularity evolution to the single active period during which the most popularity volume accumulates. Given the observations of the popularity of a piece of online information i over its popularity evolution period Li, Li ∈ N+, we define yi(t) as the popularity received by the piece of information i at time t, t ∈ {1, 2, 3, …, Li}. The data granularity is set to one hour. For example, yi(10) denotes the popularity received by i during the tenth hour. The popularity evolution of i is given by the time series {yi(1), yi(2), yi(3), …, yi(Li)}.

Burst, Peak, and Fade. Given the popularity evolution of a piece of online information, the qualitative definitions of burst, peak, and fade events are as follows. Directly after popularity undergoes the fastest rate of increase (e.g. the fastest hourly rate of increase) during its evolution, the “burst” event occurs. When popularity reaches the highest value, the “peak” event occurs. Directly after popularity undergoes the fastest rate of decrease, the “fade” event occurs.


Fig 1 indicates that popularity evolution exhibits rich temporal variation. How can we design a reasonable method that can identify the burst, peak, and fade events in variable evolution and work for all cases of popularity evolution? The six patterns found by Yang and Leskovec [2] can cover almost all cases of popularity evolution, according to Fig 2 [2]. Therefore, we discuss the identification of the events for those six patterns.

10.1371/journal.pone.0168749.g002Fig 2 The above six popularity evolution patterns of Twitter hashtags were found by Yang and Leskovec [2].
We consider two categories: Clusters P1, P2, and P3 as one, and Clusters P4, P5, and P6 as the other one. For the first category, there is only one huge spike during popularity evolution. For the second category, there are multiple spikes.

In the cases of Clusters P1, P2, and P3, popularity experiences only one huge spike. The burst, peak, and fade events are identified directly from the time series of popularity evolution in the cases of Clusters P1, P2, and P3.

If Tip∈{1,2,3,…,Li}, and yi(Tip) is the largest element in {yi(1), yi(2), yi(3), …, yi(Li)}, we say the “peak” event of i occurs at time point Tip.

If Tib∈{1,2,3,…,Tip}, and (yi(Tib)-yi(Tib-1)) is the largest element in {yi(2)-yi(1),yi(3)-yi(2),…,yi(Tip)-yi(Tip-1)}, we say the “burst” event of i occurs at time point Tib.

If Tif∈{Tip,Tip+1,Tip+2,…,Li}, and (yi(Tif)-yi(Tif+1)) is the largest element in {yi(Tip+1)-yi(Tip+2),yi(Tip+2)-yi(Tip+3),…,yi(Li-1)-yi(Li)}, we say the “fade” event of i occurs at time point Tif.

For instance, the popularity evolution of the hashtag #signedtoyoungmoney is represented by the time series {230, 2090, 2905, 1245, 466, 236, 91, 39, 27, 22, 26, …}. So the bursting, peaking, and fading times are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hour, respectively, as shown in Fig 3(a).

10.1371/journal.pone.0168749.g003Fig 3 (a) shows the burst, peak, and fade events for Clusters P1, P2, and P3. (b) shows the burst, peak, and fade events for Clusters P4, P5, and P6, and the red line is the smoothed trend which is obtained by using a SMA.

In the cases of Clusters P4, P5, and P6, popularity experiences one huge spike and several small spikes. These spikes result from people’s daily cycles [6]. Since our key events are more of a representative summary of popularity evolution, they should be identified from the trend of popularity evolution, rather than from the time series with these spikes depending on the time of day. In order to smooth these spikes (in order to mitigate the dependence on the time of day) to obtain the trend of popularity evolution, we use a simple moving average (SMA) with a window length of 24 (because there are 24 hours in one day). After using SMA, we can get a trend line, as shown by the red line in Fig 3(b). The three key events are then identified from a smoothed trend line by using the same method used in the cases of Clusters P1, P2, and P3.

We consider two categories here: Clusters P1, P2, and P3 as one, and Clusters P4, P5, and P6 as the other one. For the sake of simplicity, the two categories can be unified by applying a SMA to the second category and then the same method can be used for both categories in identifications of key events.

Data Set
Our primary data come from a portion of the ‘tweet7’ data set crawled by Yang and Leskovec [2] over a period of 7 months from June to December 2009. (This data set complies with the terms of service for the Twitter website.) The data set comprises 65 million tweets. We identify 3.3 million hashtags in these tweets. Fig 4 shows that the popularity distribution of these 3.3 million hashtags follows a power-law shape. Most of the hashtags in our data set gain very small popularity whereas only a few hashtags gain large popularity. So we select the 3000 most popular hashtags (ranked by the highest value of popularity). The three key events for each of the 3000 hashtags are recorded. All of the following studies are conducted on these selected 3000 hashtags. The statistics of the six popularity evolution patterns are shown in Table 1. (To request our data set, please contact the corresponding author or the owner of the dataset (jure@cs.stanford.edu)).

Key Event Characteristics
After introducing our data set, we take a look at the empirical cumulative distributions of bursting, peaking and fading times (how long it takes these events to occur once popularity evolution begins). Taking the green line in Fig 5 for an example, we logarithmically rescale the horizontal axes in the figures due to the large variances present among the key event times of different hashtags (notice that they range from one to several thousand). For each observed value on the green line, the empirical cumulative distribution shows the fraction of hashtags for which the bursting times are at or below this value. Fig 5 indicates that the bursting times of about 60% of hashtags are within the first ten hours during popularity evolution. Some burst events even occur in the first hour. Bursting in such a short time makes predictions more difficult and challenging. Furthermore, the fading times of over 50% of hashtags are also within the first ten hours. Therefore over 50% of popular hashtags undergo a short popularity evolution: their popularity bursts suddenly, peaks very soon, and then fades quickly.

10.1371/journal.pone.0168749.g005Fig 5 The empirical cumulative distributions of bursting, peaking, and fading times.
Since the three key events are studied simultaneously in this paper, we are interested in whether there is any relationship among them. For this, we plot peaking time versus bursting time (Fig 6(a)), fading time versus bursting time (Fig 6(b)), and fading time versus peaking time (Fig 6(c)) for each hashtag. The horizontal and vertical axes are logarithmically rescaled. It can be observed in Fig 6(a) and 6(b) that the data form two major clusters: one loose cluster in the left side of the graph, and a tighter cluster along the main diagonal. The data points along the main diagonals undergo peak and fade events quickly after bursting. The data points in the left side of Fig 6(a) and 6(b) undergo burst events in a short time (in the first ten hours), but it takes them a long time to undergo peak and fade events after bursting. The separation of the two clusters is not clear in Fig 6(c), because peaking times are not as early as bursting times. Most data points in Fig 6(c) are along the main diagonal.

10.1371/journal.pone.0168749.g006Fig 6 (a) shows the relationship between the burst and peak events. (b) shows the relationship between the burst and fade events. (c) shows the relationship between the peak and fade events.

Furthermore, to quantify the strength of the correlations in Fig 6, we measure the Pearson correlation coefficients among the three events. Table 2 shows the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) between the logarithmically transformed event times, and for comparison also the correlations between the untransformed event times. Logarithmically transformed event times show stronger correlations. Because of the strong correlations among the three events, this paper utilizes the same method to simultaneously predict burst, peak, and fade events for each hashtag.

non-log	0.90	0.71	0.84	
Solution
As we mentioned in Section 3.3, the key events usually occur in a short time, which requires us to make predictions promptly. Predicting the key events simultaneously and not separately facilitates a prompt prediction. For example, we do not have to predict a fade event until the peak event occurs. It is reasonable to predict all three events by the same method at the same time for each piece of online information. If a prediction performs well for a burst event, it should also perform well for the peak and fade event because of the strong correlations among the three events. In this section we first discuss a suitable time to make predictions. The prediction method of this paper relies on the following steps: feature extraction, feature selection, and use of the SVR (Support Vector Regression) model fed by selected features.

Determining Prediction Times
According to Fig 5, bursting times vary significantly, ranging from several hours to several weeks. It is not reasonable to wait the same time to make predictions for different kinds of popularity evolution. For those requiring several hours to burst, waiting several days results in a useless prediction. For those requiring several weeks to burst, waiting several hours cannot give us sufficient information to make a prediction. So how can we decide when to make the prediction for each individual hashtag without knowing if it will take hours or weeks to burst?

As indicated in Fig 1(a), for those hashtags requiring a long time to burst, their popularity usually remains at a very low value at the beginning, like {1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, …}. Once their popularity reaches a certain level, their popularity will increase at a faster rate. This behavior can be explained by the “rich get richer” phenomenon [29]. We therefore propose the idea that predictions are triggered once popularity reaches a certain level, e.g. once popularity reaches 20. Fig 7 shows the fraction of hashtags for which popularity reaches the corresponding x value before the “burst” event. The x axis in Fig 7 is logarithmically transformed. It is easy to understand that this fraction decreases with an increasing value of popularity, as indicated by Fig 7. Hence, predictions for most hashtags should be made before popularity reaches σ. According to Fig 7, for about 90% of hashtags, popularity reaches 40 before the “burst” event. For about 85% of hashtags, popularity reaches 50 before the “burst” event. Therefore, σ is set to 40 for our data set.

10.1371/journal.pone.0168749.g007Fig 7 The fraction of hashtags for which popularity reaches the corresponding x value before the “burst” event.
Features for Predictions of the Key Events
Temporal Features. Previous work [29] has suggested that popularity evolves according to the “rich-get-richer” phenomenon, which means that a hashtag receives new popularity at a rate proportional to the value of popularity it has already received. Hence, we deduce that the current cumulative popularity (cumuPopularity) may have impact on the bursting, peaking, and fading times. Another temporal feature is the time of day when the popularity evolution of a hashtag begins (beginningTime). This feature is taken into account because we believe that this feature affects the value popularity will reach in the next hour, which itself affects the event times. For example, a hashtag that starts its popularity evolution at 9 p.m. will receive more popularity in the next hour than a hashtag that starts its popularity evolution at 3 a.m. In the former case, popularity may burst quickly. But it may take a longer time for popularity in the latter case to burst. The last temporal feature is the amount of time it takes popularity to reach a certain level (e.g. 20) once evolution begins (levelTime), which is also the amount of time it should take for predictions to be triggered.

Social Features. We assume that celebrity involvement in discussing a hashtag accelerates the occurrences of the key events. We calculate the number of celebrities (celebrityCount) and the overall sum and maximum of the numbers of their followers (fanTotal, fanMax).

Hashtag String Features. We manually separate hashtag strings into individual words and count the number of individual words (wordCount). For example, #alovelikethisisonyourside is interpreted as “a love like this is on your side”, so this hashtag has eight individual words. Hashtags that have no clear meaning, like #abcdefg and #bbmg, are considered as one word. Another feature (stringLength) we extract from a hashtag string is the number of letters in the hashtag.

Topological Features. We also pay attention to the features of the topology networks formed by the users discussing each hashtag [30]. We denote by Ni(t) = (Vi(t), Ei(t)), the cumulative evolving network for hashtag i at hour t, t ∈ {1, 2, 3, …, Li}. The vertex set Vi(t) of Ni(t) is the set of all users who have tweeted on hashtag i in hours 0 through t. An edge between vertex u and vertex v is added to Ei(t) if u and v have a follower-following relationship, u ∈ Vi(t) and v ∈ Vi(t). The follower-following relationships come from a data set collected by Kwak et al. [28] during the same time period that the ‘tweet7’ data set was collected. Several topological features are extracted from Ni(t), including average node degree (degreeAverage), maximum node degree (degreeMax), global clustering coefficient (ccGlobal), average local clustering coefficient (ccAverage), and the number of nodes in the largest connected component (lccNodeCount).

Feature Selection
Before feeding the SVR model the above features (extracted once popularity reaches a certain level, e.g. 20), we perform feature selection by removing irrelevant and redundant features. Doing so can unburden the training process and help us understand which feature best captures the bursting, peaking, and fading time. First, we investigate the Pearson correlation between each feature and each event time to remove irrelevant features. Each cell of Fig 8 shows the pairwise correlation between the corresponding event time and feature. The correlation’s magnitude is represented by the circle symbol, and its sign is represented by colors, with red used for negative values and blue for positive values. Fig 8 indicates that levelTime and celebrityCount have high correlations with bursting, peaking, and fading time. beginningTime and fanMax are not related with the event times. Note that each row in Fig 8 looks very similar, which also indicates the three event times are highly correlated with each other. After removing irrelevant features, the remaining ones are levelTime, celebrityCount, degreeAvarage, and ccAverage.

Second, we study the Pearson correlations among these features to remove redundant features. Fig 9 shows the correlation matrix for all features. Some of the features have high pairwise correlations, such as lccNodeCount and degreeMax, lccNodeCount and cumuPopularity, fanMax and fanTotal. After removing irrelevant and redundant features according to Figs 8 and 9, the remaining ones are levelTime, and ccAverage.

Evaluation
This section discusses how this task is evaluated. First, traditional evaluation metrics, which only consider accuracy, are adopted to evaluate our solution. We compare our solution with others in terms of traditional evaluation metrics. Second, a new evaluation metric, which considers both accuracy and promptness, is specifically designed for this task.

Experimental setup
According to the tips on practical use of the SVR model [31], we first try small and large values for the general penalizing parameter (C) with exponentially growing sequences, like 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, then decide which are better for the data by cross validation minimizing MAPE, and finally try several kernel parameter γs (like 100, 10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4) for the better Cs. For our data set, C is set to 1000, and γ is set to 0.0001. In the following two-sided paired t-tests we conduct to compare our solution with other solutions, the sample size (n) is 3000.

Traditional Evaluation
Overall Performance
The overall performance of our solution is evaluated in terms of the minimum, quartiles, and maximum values of prediction errors (Eq 1) and relative errors (Eq 2). We perform a 5-fold cross-validation. We evaluate predictions made at different time points (e.g. the time points once popularity reaches 10, 20, 30, and 40).  Errori=|ti′-ti|(1)  
 RelativeErrori=|ti′-ti|ti(2)  
where ti′ is the predicted event time of the hashtag i, and ti is the actual event time.

Note that in some cases relative errors are larger than 1 because of low actual value and high predicted value. Table 3 gives the fractions of relative errors exceeding 1 for different predictions. In the cases where burst and peak predictions are triggered when popularity reaches 10, the fraction values are about 30%. These high fraction values result from bad prediction performance and low actual values. In accordance with standard procedure in the prediction field, we set relative errors to 1 when they exceed 1.

10.1371/journal.pone.0168749.t003Table 3 Fractions of relative errors exceeding one for the predictions triggered once popularity reaches 10, 20, 30, and 40.
	10	20	30	40	
burst	31.56%	7.44%	2.76%	2.99%	
peak	30.10%	19.81%	7.52%	1.15%	
fade	5.37%	1.15%	0.92%	1.13%	

Table 4 shows the minimum, quartile (Q1 (the first quartile), Q2 (median), and Q3 (the third quartile)), and maximum error values for predictions of the three event. We can make the following observations. (1) Overall errors decrease with prediction time for predictions of all three events. This is consistent with the intuition that the later we predict, the more accurate the prediction is. (2) Taking the predictions triggered once popularity reaches 20 for an example. For 50% of hashtags, the difference between the predicted bursting (peaking) time and the actual bursting (peaking) time is less than one hour. For 75% of hashtags, this time difference is less than two hours. For 50% of hashtags, the difference between the predicted fading time and the actual fading time is less than one hour. For 75% of hashtags, this time difference is less than for hours. (3) The errors for fade event predictions are usually not as low as those for burst and peak event predictions, which can be explained by Fig 8: the correlations between the selected features and fading times are not as high as those between the selected features and bursting and peaking times. (4) The maximum error values for all three event predictions are large (greater than 200 hours), which results from the points not along the main diagonals in Fig 6.

Relative errors are presented in Fig 10. The box-and-whisker plot shows the minimum, quartiles, and maximum error values. The bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartile error values, respectively, and the band inside the box is the median error value. The upper and lower whiskers are the maximum and minimum error values, respectively. The position of the median band becomes lower as prediction time increases, which indicates that the overall prediction performance improves as prediction time increases. The third and fourth boxes in Fig 10(a) show that the median value of relative errors is zero if burst event predictions are triggered once popularity reaches 30 or 40. The third and fourth boxes in Fig 10(b) show that the median values of relative errors are about 0.2 and 0.05 if peak event predictions are triggered once popularity reaches 30 and 40, respectively. The third and fourth boxes in Fig 10(c) show that the median values of relative errors are about 0.3 and 0.35 if fade event predictions are triggered once popularity reaches 30 and 40, respectively.

Comparison
To validate the effectiveness of our solution, this paper compares our solution with the following solutions in terms of (1-RelativeError). We also perform 5-fold cross-validations.

Using all features (AF). To show the efficiency of performing the feature selection, we compare our solution using only the selected features with another solution using all the features.

Using Bayesian linear regression (BLR). We replace the SVR model in our solution with another machine learning model known as Bayesian linear regression.

SpikeM. Due to the fact that predicting the burst, peak, and fade events is a new prediction task, most of the existing models for popularity evolution prediction are not capable of solving this task. To compare our solution with existing work, we choose a model which can solve this task but is not specialized for it, the SpikeM model [4]. We train the SpikeM model by using popularity data up to the time of prediction to obtain the whole predicted popularity evolution. Then the three event times can be inferred from the whole predicted popularity evolution.

The first and second boxes in each subfigure of Fig 11 and Table 5 show the comparison between our solution and the solution using all features. For better visualization in Fig 11, each prediction error is increased by one hour, and then presented on the logarithmically rescaled vertical axis. For predictions of all three events, we can see that the median error values resulting from using the selected features are about two or three hours lower than those resulting from using all the features. We conduct a significance test (Table 5) to further compare, in terms of (1−RelativeError), our solution with the solution using all the features. d¯ denotes the mean of (1−RelativeError) differences. V denotes the variance of (1−RelativeError) differences. p denotes the p-value. ES denotes the effect size. CI denotes the confidence interval. According to a two-sided paired t-test for the difference in means d¯=0.26 (with the unbiased estimate of the population variance V = 0.32), burst event predictions using only the selected features statistically significantly outperform burst event predictions using all the features (p < 0.05, ES = 0.4634, 95% CI[0.2072, 0.3132]). This is similarly true for peak and fade event predictions. The reason for the better performance of our solution is that the irrelevant and redundant features disturb the learning process of the SVR model, and removing the irrelevant and redundant features helps improve the prediction results.

The first and third boxes in each subfigure of Fig 11 and Table 6 show the comparison between our solution and the solution using the BLR model. For burst and peak predictions, the median error values resulting from using our solution are about two or three hours lower than those resulting from using the BLR model. For fade predictions, the median error value resulting from using our solution is about seven hours lower than that resulting from using the BLR model. We conduct a significance test (Table 6) to further compare our solution with the solution using the BLR model. According to a two-sided paired t-test for the difference in means d¯=0.35 (with the unbiased estimate of the population variance V = 0.26), our solution statistically significantly outperforms the solution using the BLR model (p < 0.05, ES = 0.69, 95% CI[0.31, 0.40]). This is similarly true for peak and fade event predictions.

fade	0.43	0.17	1.05	0.00	[0.39, 0.47]	
The first and fourth boxes in each subfigure of Fig 11 and Table 7 show the comparison between our solution and the SpikeM model. For burst and peak predictions, the median error values resulting from using our solution are about three hours lower than those resulting from using the SpikeM model. For fade predictions, the median error value resulting from using our solution is about eight hours lower than that resulting from using the SpikeM model. We conduct a significance test (Table 7) to further compare our solution with the SpikeM model. According to a two-sided paired t-test for the difference in means d¯=0.44 (with the unbiased estimate of the population variance V = 0.25), our solution statistically significantly outperforms the SpikeM model (p < 0.05, ES = 0.87, 95% CI[0.39, 0.49]). This is similarly true for peak and fade event predictions. The main reason for the non-optimal performance of the SpikeM model is that the SpikeM model only considers popularity data, and popularity data are sparse and do not contain enough information to learn the parameters of the SpikeM model due to the quick occurrence of the key events.

fade	0.44	0.17	1.07	0.00	[0.41, 0.48]	
New Evaluation
As we discussed in Section 3.3, some of key events occur in a very short time once popularity evolution begins. Because of this special characteristic, we argue that traditional evaluation metrics (e.g. error, relative error, RMSE, and MAPE, etc.) have a flaw in evaluating this task and that the promptness of a prediction should be taken into account. For instance, we have two hashtags, say A and B. The predictions for the two hashtags are triggered at the 3rd and 5th hours. The prediction results for A and B are both (5, 6, 7). That is, we estimate that A’s and B’s popularity will burst at the 5th hour, peak at the 6th hour, and fade at the 7th hour. The actual results for A and B are both (4, 5, 6). The prediction accuracies are the same for A and B, but the prediction for B is triggered after the popularity bursts. From an application point of view, it is meaningless to make a key event prediction after the key event already occurs. Still taking A and B for an example, this time we make predictions at 2nd and 3rd hours. Their predicted and actual results are the same as those in the first example. This time the predictions for both hashtags are triggered before the key events. From the perspective of stopping rumors and controlling information diffusion, we have two hours left to take actions for A but only one hour for B. Hence, the traditional metrics that only take accuracy into account are not enough. We need a new evaluation metric which considers not only accuracy but also promptness.

This new evaluation metric is constructed like an F1 score. It has two ingredients: correctness score (CS, given in Eq 3) and promptness score (PS, given in Eq 4), so we call this new evaluation metric balanced CP score. A balanced CP score balances accuracy and promptness. Given the results of a key event prediction, its balanced CP score is given in Eq 5 according to the following rules.

Rule 1. In some cases correctness scores (1-RelativeError) are lower than 0 because relative errors are higher than 1, as we discussed in Section 5.1.1. We set correctness scores in these cases to 0.

Rule 2. If a prediction is triggered before popularity evolution, the corresponding promptness score is set to 1. If a prediction is triggered after a key event time, the corresponding promptness score is set to 0.  CSi=1-|ti′-ti|ti,|ti′-ti|≤ti0,|ti′-ti|>ti(3)  
 PSi=ti-ti′′ti,ti′′≤ti0,ti′′>ti(4)  
 BalancedCPScorei=2CSi*PSiCSi+PSi(5)  
where ti′′ is the key event prediction time of hashtag i.

We use the average of balanced CP scores to evaluate the predictions at different time points. We conduct a 5-fold cross-validation. According to Fig 12(a), for predictions of all three events, the average correctness score increases with prediction time. The reason for this is that the later we make predictions, the stronger correlations are between the selected features and the event times. In Table 4, errors for fade event predictions are larger than errors for peak event predictions, but in Fig 12, the average correctness scores for fade event predictions made at earlier time points are higher than those for peak event predictions. This is because actual fading times are larger than actual peaking times and correctness scores sometimes become higher when actual values are larger. According to Fig 12(b), for predictions of all three events, the average promptness score decreases with prediction time. It is obvious that the later we predict, the lower the values of promptness scores are. Burst event predictions are not as prompt as the peak event predictions, because a burst event always occurs after the corresponding peak event. According to Fig 12(c), balanced CP score tends to become saturated as prediction time increases for predictions of all three events.

Conclusions
In this paper we bring forward a new and challenging prediction task in the field of popularity evolution: predicting when the “burst”, “peak”, and “fade” key events occur. The challenges of identifying the events in different popularity evolution patterns with high variation, and making accurate yet prompt predictions, are addressed for this task. This paper presents a solution based on the characteristics of the events. Comparative results show that our solution outperforms three other solutions in terms of accuracy. We design a new evaluation metric (balanced CP score) and show how to use this metric to evaluate the quality (both accuracy and promptness) of predictions at different times. Furthermore, we find that the popularity of more than half the hashtags in our selected data set bursts suddenly, peaks very soon, and then fades quickly, that these events have strong correlations with each other, and that the levelTime feature has the most effect on this prediction task compared to other features.

Predictions concerning those points not along the main diagonals in Fig 6 need to be improved in future work. There is another interesting area that we did not explore here: What characteristics do the two clusters in Fig 6 have? We have a rough look into these two clusters. We find that the hashtags in the left cluster tend to have more specific meanings with longer strings, like #lieswomentell, #WorldsThinnestBooks, and #itsnotgonnawork, while the other hashtags are vaguer, like #mnf, #Packers, and #eBay. Our future research will address this question as well.
