We review and present the current literature on teleglaucoma; present our experience with teleglaucoma programs in Alberta, Canada and Western Australia; and discuss the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field. Teleglaucoma is a novel area that was first explored a little over a decade ago and early studies highlighted the technical challenges of delivering glaucoma care remotely. Advanced technologies have since emerged that show great promise in providing access to underserviced populations. Additionally, these technologies can improve the efficiency of healthcare systems burdened with an increasing number of patients with glaucoma, and a limited supply of ophthalmologists. Additional benefits of teleglaucoma systems include e-learning and e-research. Further work is needed to fully validate and study the cost and comparative effectiveness of this approach relative to traditional models of healthcare.

INTRODUCTION
Spurred by the rapid rise in the use of information and communication technology, the telemedicine revolution has significantly enhanced the potential for equitable access to the expertise of an eye-care specialist, particularly in underserviced and rural areas.12 The American Telemedicine Association defines telemedicine as the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve the health status of a patient.3 In keeping with this, we define teleglaucoma as the application of electronic technologies to detect and manage patients with or at risk of glaucoma. Important parameters in this type of delivery of healthcare include timeliness, quality, efficiency, and patient and provider acceptability. An ongoing concern of incorporating teleophthalmology into clinical care has been maintenance of proper standards and quality control. Thus it has become particularly important to be able to rigorously validate protocols similar to the model of diabetic retinopathy.45

Glaucomas represent a diverse group of diseases that have in common characteristic changes in the optic nerve neuroretinal rim tissue. An American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) ophthalmic technology assessment in 2007 reported that serial stereophotography of the optic nerve head is considered the reference standard of care for patients with glaucoma.6 A more recent assessment of the value of glaucoma tests emphasized that optic nerve examination as performed by a clinical exam or via stereo-disc photographs remains the foundation of glaucoma diagnosis.7 Other fundamental factors critical to diagnosis and management include integrating history, examination, as well as other structural and functional assessments. Considering that structural and functional assessment form the basis of diagnosis and monitoring progression, and that there are finite human, financial and other resources, a key question is how to optimize care for patients with glaucoma or at risk of developing glaucoma. This is an important consideration when one considers that common forms of glaucoma increase in prevalence with age and all projections indicate that the elderly population will expand considerably over the next decade. Optimal delivery of care is the impetus for teleglaucoma: providing access to those who do not currently receive it and efficiency to relieve an already burdened healthcare system in many countries with significant constraints on the supply of eye-care professionals.8

In this article, we review the available literature on teleglaucoma, share our experience with programs in Canada and Australia, and present opportunities and challenges for this emerging and evolving field.

LITERATURE TO DATE
The first studies published on teleglaucoma were in 1999. Yogesan et al.,9 and Li et al.,10 compared digital optic nerve assessments to slide film demonstrating strong and moderate agreement, respectively. Tuulonen et al.,11 evaluated access, efficiency and cost effectiveness for glaucoma care. They11 showed that the costs for telemedicine and conventional visits were equal; however, patients were extremely satisfied with their personal cost and time saving. However, in the study,11 image quality captured from video clips using frame grabbing technology was compromised compared with the digital imaging system at their university eye clinic. Similarly, a study by Labiris et al.,12 reported technical difficulties with video transmission or communication in 13/56 attempted telemedical glaucoma consultations via a mobile unit. A large study (N = 1729) from The Netherlands in 2004 assessed a shared care glaucoma screening model via image transmission, and reported satisfactory image quality in 89% of the cases, and a fairly good correlation between optometrists and trained in-hospital technicians in cases with suspicious findings (81%).13 This study13 was performed by scanning laser polarimetry to analyze the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and determine whether a patient had glaucoma. In 2008, Blαzquez et al.,14 found that patients had a very high acceptance rate for glaucoma screening via telemedicine. Blαzquez et al.,14 performed a large study that integrated results from Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT), Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) and intraocular pressures (IOPs) that were electronically transmitted to an ophthalmologist for interpretation. A study by Kumar et al.,15 found good correlation between digital cup-to-disc ratios and ophthalmoscopy for 399 eyes. The Kumar et al.,15 study also showed that IOP measurements did not enhance the sensitivity of a teleglaucoma screening program, which suggests IOP may be useful for telemonitoring but not telescreening.

Despite the promising results of these early studies, controversy remains regarding the sensitivity and specificity of stereoscopic digital imaging of the optic nerve head compared with the gold standard of stereoscopic slide film photography. Several studies have compared digital optic nerve images to slide film with encouraging but mixed results when compared with the gold standard [Table 1].91016–18 More conclusive validation studies are required, taking into consideration that correlation studies between digital images and the gold standard are dependent on the image quality obtained from the device as well as viewing techniques and resolution.

TELEGLAUCOMA PROGRAMS IN CANADA AND AUSTRALIA
We describe our experience at University of Alberta using a store and forward system as well as our experience in Western Australia using real-time videoconferencing for glaucoma diagnosis and management.

The teleglaucoma program at University of Alberta fits into a wider concept of collaborative care that integrates various eye-care professionals in order to provide streamlined, efficient management [Figure 1]. A key feature is of this program is stratification based on known glaucoma risk factors followed by management by the appropriate provider (optometrist or ophthalmologist). The Canadian Ophthalmological Society has recognized the importance of this concept with their committee's guidelines on inter-professional collaboration in glaucoma.19 It proposes that the solution to glaucoma care has to be patient-centered with the objective of improving access and quality of care; consideration must be given to geographic and ethnic differences, as well as the different needs of different types of patients, and consideration must also be given to all parties involved, including the various professionals involved in ocular care, patients, government and healthcare providers.

The principles outlined in Table 2 form the foundation of our teleglaucoma program along with the following four pillars: human resources (including proper governance and healthcare teamwork); adequate information technology support; appropriate provision of equipment; sound protocols; and best practices for quality e-consultation, e-learning and e-research.

Table 2 Principles for the teleglaucoma program at University of Alberta

Key to teleglaucoma assessment is the information provided by a standardized ophthalmic and medical history [Table 3], slit-lamp examination, IOPs, visual fields, and standardized 30- or 45-degree fundus photographs. Grading occurs using cathode ray tube monitors, an emitter box (a device that facilitates stereoviewing), three-dimensional professional video cards and LCD shutter glasses. The digital photographs are compressed at a ratio of 16:1 and viewed at a resolution of 1024 × 1280 pixels. This viewing protocol has been validated for use in diabetic retinopathy screening.4 Once read, a PDF report is generated with management recommendations that are sent back to the referring eye-care provider and in-person follow-up is arranged as warranted.20 The report has a disclaimer that recognizes the limitations of the consult in assessing the secondary causes of glaucoma such as angle closure, pseudoexfoliation, pigment dispersion and uveitis. It also reinforces that clinical suspicion determines whether an in-person examination may be warranted. Lastly, the disclaimer describes the confidentiality of the teleglaucoma examination and reviews the research into this pilot program. This approach has been developed in order to ensure efficiency is appropriately balanced with quality.

Table 3 Standardized history and testing protocol for teleglaucoma at University of Alberta. Adapted from Kassam et al.20

The Alberta program is comprised of two sub-programs: ‘Remote’ and ‘In-house’. Both these are store and forward teleglaucoma systems. The Remote program involves both diagnosis and management of glaucoma suspects remotely, with in-person exam arranged at the location and with a provider as appropriate. It operates as a ‘hub-and-spoke’ framework of delivery [Figure 2]. This involves web-based evaluation of information provided remotely by general ophthalmologists and optometrists (spokes), which is interpreted by a glaucoma specialist (at the hub) who follows up with recommendations. Fifteen optometrists and a comprehensive ophthalmologist that are properly equipped [Table 4], and whose staff has undergone training, have been recruited to the pilot program for teleconsultation. Standardized history [Table 3], slit-lamp examination, corneal pachymetry, fundus photographs, visual fields such as FDT or Humphrey Visual Fields, and any other available ancillary testing such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) or HRT are uploaded to the proprietary software Secure Diagnostic Imaging server. The Secure Diagnostic Imaging software is made available to all optometrists in the pilot trial free of cost. One of four ophthalmologists, all glaucoma subspecialists, completes the consults. Interpretation requires special monitors and LCD shutter glasses for stereoscopic assessment of the nerve. The specialists review all of the information supplied within 10 days, including optic nerve assessment, and make appropriate recommendations for management of the patient. A standardized report is automatically generated and sent electronically to the referring optometrist or comprehensive ophthalmologist. Follow-up is arranged with the specialist if needed or repeat teleconsultation with the optometrist, if recommended. A copy of the report can also be mailed to the patient if they wish, with the hope of empowering the patient and improving health education. This approach is primarily intended for patients who live in underserviced areas, but could be utilized in semi-urban communities as well.20

Table 4 Components needed for ‘hub-and-spoke’ delivery of teleglaucoma

The In-house program runs at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton, Canada (tertiary academic center), and at a private glaucoma group practice. Regular referrals that are received for glaucoma assessments are assessed for teleglaucoma suitability – typically patients who are likely suspects or may have early stages of glaucoma – and for those who do not fulfill any of the exclusion criteria listed in Table 5. If the patient is eligible, the appropriate anticipated tests and exams are ordered as per existing clinic protocols. The teleglaucoma program coordinator informs the patient and referring eye-care professional about the program, and if the patient is interested they are booked for the visit. Both the patient and referring optometrist are notified via a notification letter once the appointment is made. The visit involves a patient's encounter with an ophthalmic technician or nurse who performs a detailed history and slit-lamp examination, visual field testing, fundus photography and OCT [Figure 3]. The goal of the In-house teleglaucoma program is to provide access to glaucoma assessment within 1 month (typical access time is 3–4 months) and reduce cycle time (defined as the time from registration until departure, including testing, seeing the technician and physician) to less than 90 min (currently about 120 min for in-person exams).20 Periodically, complete evaluations are performed to assess the overall program, including outcomes of consultations, efficiency and effectiveness. This includes feedback from the patient, referring and consultation provider, and recommendations for improvement. Thus far, early data show potentially improved efficiency compared with conventional visits with time and cost-benefits.21 Medicare in Alberta currently reimburses teleconsultation in both the Remote and In-house programs at approximately two-thirds of a conventional in-person fee.

In Australia, there has been a fee for online consultations from Medicare since July 2011; however, this covers only real-time consultations and is the main difference between the Canadian and Australian programs. The patient is required to visit a primary care provider or a medical clinic to connect to an ophthalmologist for diagnostic advice. The consultation could take place over an internet-based communication service such as Skype. The ophthalmologist receives high-resolution images and other data using a store and forward system (EHR) and then speaks to the patient and the primary care provider to provide disease management and recommendations. In Western Australia, a proprietary web-based system called Remote-I is being utilized to connect primary care providers to ophthalmologists in rural and remote locations. The system combines video conferencing and store and forward technology such that the ophthalmologists providing telemedicine consultation can meet the requirements to charge a fee for service from Medicare. Ophthalmologists are able to connect to Remote-I using a tablet device such as an iPad in order to provide glaucoma consultations remotely at their convenience. Video conferencing and the ability to view high-resolution retinal images are also possible through the system. Additionally, tools are available, which can assist in clinical decision-making such as automated estimation of cup-to-disc ratio and rim width. It can also compare images of optic nerves at different time points to alert the clinician of possible disease progression.

LEARNING AND PERSPECTIVES
To date, our program has been very well received by ophthalmologists, glaucoma specialists, optometrists, ophthalmic nurses and technicians in Northern Alberta. The program can be run with focus on glaucoma or potentially as part of a broader teleophthalmology approach to detection of other eye disorders (e.g., with diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration).22 One of the key success factors for both programs is reimbursement for service as this is an important component of physician adoption. However, in Australia the store and forward technology is not included in this Medicare item. The ophthalmologist must speak to the patient who is with a primary care provider and then review images and other data using EHR, which places constraints on refining and improving the processes. Both the Australian and Canadian programs leverage existing teleophthalmology platforms and serve as two examples of how teleglaucoma can be delivered, but many other possibilities exist. Replication of these or similar models in other settings is highly dependent on the environment of the healthcare system in which the program is being initiated.

Any telemedicine approach comes with medico-legal risks and must be closely considered when implementing a teleglaucoma program. Fortunately, the Canadian Medical Protective Association has guidelines on collaborative care and e-health. Furthermore, guidance is offered by the American Telemedicine Association for telehealth practice related to diabetic retinopathy and the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Standard.23–25 Important considerations include that each party involved in a shared care model must have adequate medico-legal coverage, there must be timely and clear communication between providers, well-developed standards for care, and confidentiality of patient information and backup of data. These guidelines are crucial to the development and progression of teleglaucoma programs. Our programs are developed within the context of the larger evidence-based Canadian Glaucoma Guidelines and AAO Preferred Practice Patterns for Glaucoma.2627

There are a number of limitations to teleglaucoma. First, telemedicine strategies may put the patient–physician relationship at risk. This must be carefully considered and ultimately communication and empathy will shift heavily onto front-line staff collecting diagnostic information (technicians, photographers, nurses, optometrists, etc). Additionally, reporting information back to the patient in a timely manner, and continuously assessing and responding to patient feedback will be important. Hence, staff will require ongoing training in these areas. Second, as with any consultation in medicine, there are sensitive issues surrounding patient ownership and scope of practice, thus a collaborative stakeholder approach is important. A third limitation of teleglaucoma is gonioscopic assessment to obtain information about the angle. In some cases, referring ophthalmologists and optometrists provide gonioscopy information. In our In-house program, we employed anterior segment imaging with OCT or Pentacam, which can assist in determining iris configuration and whether the angle is open. However, both these modalities do not provide direct information about the angle structures (such as presence of angle pigment or neovascularization) and they do not replace compression gonioscopy. Finally, the software and user interface design is a critical component of the efficiency of completing teleconsultation. Consultation time could be reduced significantly by using drop-down menus and multiple screens to display all investigations concurrently.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As more centers begin to utilize telemedicine approaches for glaucoma diagnosis and management, a comprehensive set of standards and best practices should be created similar to those created by the American Telemedicine Association for diabetic retinopathy. There are still several questions that need to be addressed prior to determining the exact utility of teleglaucoma. For example, what is the optimal image compression ratio for the optic nerve? Can stereo-imaging be performed without stereo-glasses? How much value does stereoscopic imaging add to the diagnosis? Can our models be replicated and validated in other healthcare settings? Could teleglaucoma be used to diagnose and manage acute presentations? To date, existing data suggest that IOP plays little role in glaucoma screening, but its role in telemonitoring remains to be determined. A collaborative research group for projects related to teleglaucoma would be a worthwhile initiative to share knowledge, skills, approaches and design research to improve teleglaucoma delivery and determine best practices.

As with many areas of telemedicine, teleglaucoma can eventually evolve to be most useful in serving the poorest populations in the developing world. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, among other regions, have a significant burden of glaucoma. Additionally, access to care is challenging as much of the population resides in rural areas and there can be geographic barriers to reaching subspecialists. Similar to our model, spoke stations strategically positioned in remote areas could be created, with images and diagnostic information being digitally transferred to the urban centers with follow-up and intervention as needed. Crucial to this is strong institutional capacity and local empowerment, as well as training subspecialty experts for these developing regions.28

Teleglaucoma also carries with it the potential for e-learning and e-research by utilizing the large volume of captured disc images. These images could be used to teach fellows, residents and medical students, and may provide important epidemiological information to better understand the disease process in rural areas worldwide. In the developing world particularly, acceptability is dependent on the ability to use teleglaucoma in low-resource settings. This in turn requires equipment innovation that is low-cost and has multiple functions (e.g., one device to take pictures of the anterior segment, including the angle, as well as the fundus). Along similar lines, advances are needed in diagnostic equipment use, automated analysis,29 and determining how progression of the optic nerve will be displayed and identified. Standardized grading such as rim-to-disc ratios or a disc damage likelihood scale may prove to be increasingly powerful tools in monitoring progression.30 Many novel research applications may develop with teleglaucoma, including support for conducting multicenter trials.31

The increased prevalence of mobile phones and the internet worldwide is being used in innovative ways to improve patient health.32 There are many ways this can be integrated into glaucoma care such as special applications or text reminders for patients to take glaucoma medications and online visual field testing.33 Although we should be mindful of ensuring high standards and quality, this should be balanced with the significant potential for patient empowerment using these technologies. This was highlighted by a recent case in which a glaucoma patients who lived a 5-h drive from the academic center e-mailed one of us (LRP) a picture of his eye (with an infected bleb) from his cellular device [Figure 4] asking if it was a cause for concern.

Figure 4 Picture taken with a cellular device by a patient e-mailed to his physician

Another crucial area for further research is health economics, cost effectiveness and comparative effectiveness when delivering this type of care. A systematic review of economic evaluations in telemedicine highlighted the diversity in economic evaluations and methodology, making these types of analyses challenging.34 In ophthalmology specifically, it does appear that the telemedicine approach in vitreoretinal diseases is cost-effective.35 Intimately linked to cost effectiveness and the potential success of teleglaucoma is determination of reimbursement models for providers when utilizing the service. In countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia, public healthcare programs are willing to reimburse for teleglaucoma and teleretinal screening programs given the potential cost savings, although this can vary by state/provincial governments and have strict requirements (e.g., live conferencing). In resource-poor settings, it will be more challenging to involve the government and implementation will greatly depend on innovative business models for paying patients as well as cheaper IT startup equipment.

CONCLUSION
We believe teleglaucoma could transform how glaucoma is diagnosed and managed both in the developing and developed world. The literature to date has demonstrated some successes but highlights that delivery of quality teleglaucoma care is deeply intertwined with the quality of available technology and systems. Our experiences in Canada and Australia are part of a collaborative approach to care. These programs have shown great promise in optimizing processes to provide comprehensive teleglaucoma service; however, technical and psychosocial limitations remain. Furthermore, general acceptability by patients and providers is dependent on the healthcare system and the population being serviced, and it may not work well in all settings. Significant research is warranted to validate teleglaucoma assessments compared with the gold standard. Additionally, evaluation of cost efficiency compared with traditional models of healthcare delivery is required. We encourage other studies that explore this emerging area that has the potential to improve patient access and increase efficiency for glaucoma-related care.

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor resulting into osteoid or bone and accounts for 23% of craniofacial malignancies.[12345] Osteosarcomas commonly affect distal femur, proximal humerus parts, and proximal tibia.[1] Osteosarcomas of the jaw account for 2-10% of all sarcomas. It has been observed that osteosarcomas affect more commonly in mandible than in maxilla.[2] In maxilla, lesions are commonly seen at the alveolar ridge, sinus floor, and palate than at the superior aspects (zygoma, orbit).[6] There is no gender predilection, however, some authors consider more predilection in females. Nearly 60% of the osteosarcomas are seen in children and adolescents, and approximately 10% are noted during the third decade of life.[17] The etiology is unclear.[8]

The term osteosarcoma refers to the primary malignant neoplasm of heterogeneous nature affecting bone formation or mesenchymal tissues having a histopathological evidence of osteogenic differentiation.[18] Various types of osteosarcomas have been defined such as intramedullary low and high grade osteosarcoma, telangiectatic, small cell, and multifocal types. Other types include parosteal, periosteal, intracortical, high-grade surface, extraskeletal, and gnathic osteosarcomas.[9] Chondroblastic osteosarcoma is the most common variant of osteosarcoma of jaw bones, whereas osteoblastic osteosarcoma are common variant reported in the long bones.[4]

Osteosarcoma shows high metastatic rate and can be more aggressive. Jaw region osteosarcomas have a relatively low incidence of metastasis with good prognosis.[6] Because of the occurrence of the tumor at a young age, its aggressive nature, and chances of recurrence, there is need of sound clinical knowledge to diagnose and manage it.[1]

CASE REPORT
A 20 year-old male patient was referred to the maxillofacial surgery department with chief complaint of a rapidly growing swelling in the left upper back tooth region associated with pain. The patient had been noticing the swelling over a period of 2 weeks.

Clinical examination revealed an expansile swelling in the maxillary tuberosity region measuring 5 cm × 3 cm [Figure 1]. The swelling was tender on palpation and smooth in texture. Patient had parasthesia and pain in the involved areas. Facial asymmetry was evident. However, mouth opening was normal. Clinically, there was no regional lymph node involvement. No other relevant family and medical history could be elicited. Patient was advised an orthopantamogram and a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan. A typical sun ray appearance was seen in the CBCT. The tumor was found to involve the entire maxillary sinus and superiorly extending onto the inferior orbital rim. Posterior extension was seen up to the pterygoid plates and medial extension to the lateral wall of the nose [Figure 2].

An incisional biopsy was confirmatory of osteosarcoma. A Weber Fergusson incision was planned for access to the tumor. Adequate access was obtained and resection of the tumor with at least 1 cm clearance was done at all the margins, and the specimen sent for histopathologic examination. Because of the extensive defect and considering the psychological status of the patient, reconstruction of the defect was planned. An anterolateral thigh flap was harvested and used for reconstruction, which also created a lining for the oral cavity [Figure 3]. Patient was on Ryle's tube feeding for 3 weeks. Postoperative healing was uneventful. Histopathologic report confirmed the diagnosis of osteosarcoma which was of the chondroblastic variety. The anterior, posterior, and lateral margins were found to be free of tumor. The superior, inferior, and medial margins shows tumor involvement, and hence, as per the medical oncologist's opinion, postoperative radiotherapy was started. Anterior and lateral portal radiation in combination with chemotherapy was done. Patient has been reviewed for the past 1 year and no evidence of recurrence has been noticed in clinical and radiographic evaluation [Figures 4 and 5].

DISCUSSION
Osteosarcoma commonly affects long bones and rarely affects jaw bones.[110] Clinically, osteosarcoma presents with paresthesia, swelling, facial deformity, toothache, persistent pain, loose teeth, and sometimes presents with ulceration, epistaxis, eye problem, and nasal obstruction. Systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy are rare. It usually does not metastasize to the lymph node.[1231011] The diagnosis of osteosarcoma is based on clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic features.[1]

Osteosarcomas radiographically show bone expansion. Its radiographic features depend on the interaction of three processes, that is, bone formation and mineralization, bone destruction, and periosteal bone formation.[210] It may present as a radiopacity, radiolucency, or of mixed nature with widening of the periodontal ligament space. Radiographically, it presents as classic “sunray or sunburst” appearance due to osteophytic bone production.[14] CT is used for definitive diagnosis to determine its extent and to check lung metastasis.[123]

Tissue biopsy of the lesions helps in definitive diagnosis. Osteosarcoma presents with variable histologic features. Sarcomatous stroma produces osteoid. The stromal cells may be osteoblastic, chondroblastic, and/or fibroblastic.[1] There is a focal area of atypical haphazardly arranged spindle-shaped cells with myxomatous areas. Deeper areas show chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils, along with areas of numerous vascular channels.[4]

Surgical excision of osteosarcoma is challenging to the dentist since adequate sectioning of tumor and its reconstruction is difficult, particularly in maxilla, due to its complex anatomy. Osteosarcomas of the jaws are usually managed by wide surgical resection, along with chemotherapy and irradiation.[2]

We have reported a rare case report of osteosarcoma of maxilla, which was confirmed on the basis of CT scan. There was involvement of superior and inferior border of maxilla and possibility of orbital involvement, and hence, surgical excision of the lesion followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy to protect the orbital region was done.

Usually a temporal flap or radial forearm flap are suggested to correct the deformity after excision of the lesion. Some authors suggested use of soft tissue flap for correction of defect from various parts of the body such as abdominis, rectus femoris, latissimus dorsi, tensor fasciae latae myocutaneous, and arm.[12] In the present case, tumor was excised and the deformity was corrected using thigh flap for esthetic purpose as requested by the patient. This was followed by postoperative chemotherapy in combination of chemotherapy using the following drugs: ifosfamide –200 mg for 4 days, doxorubicin –60 mg on day 1, and cisplatin –40 mg on 1, 2, and 3 days. These drugs were administered once in 21 days. Two-dimensional radiotherapy using60 Cobalt with a total dose of 5500–200 cGy/day in divided doses was administered. The frequency of dosing was 5 days/week for 5.5 weeks. A total of 6-9 cycles were planned and completed. The patient has been reviewed for 1 year, and there was no evidence of recurrence during follow-up visits.

CONCLUSION
Clinical management of osteosarcoma of the maxilla is challenging to the dentist. Early diagnosis and complete resection of tumor along negative margins helps in better prognosis. An attempt has been made to use postoperative radiotherapy in this case due to the presence of positive margins with concomitant use of postoperative chemotherapy.

Introduction
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe congenital malformations in the central nervous system. It has been reported that 50%~70% of NTDs in human could be prevented by the periconceptional consumption of folic acid[1–3]. However, the exact mechanism between folate deficiency and NTDs remains unclear.

Folic acid is converted to active tetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and then participates in the process of one-carbon unit transfer. This process plays a critical role in the methylation of DNA[4]. Two times epigenetic reprogramming was occurred in early embryonic development, including rapid demethylation and re-methylation, to remove parental genomic imprinting and establish the embryonic DNA methylation patterns. When folate deficiency was caused by various factors in embryogenesis, the methylation patterns of normal embryonic development may be changed, resulting in birth defects. In the previous study, we found that methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element-1(LINE-1) may be a potential indicator for global DNA methylation, and hypomethylation of LINE-1 and genomic DNA was associated with an increased risk for NTDs [5]. Folate deficiency affected the homeostasis of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, leading to reduced LINE-1 methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [6]. Copp [7] et al reported that the incidence of NTDs increased when the methylation cycle were inhibited in mouse and chick animal models. Waterland[8] et al showed that dietary methyl supplementation with extra folic acid, vitamin B (12), choline, and betaine altered the phenotype of their offspring via increased CpG methylation. DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) plays an important role in the inheritance of genomic DNA methylation. Early embryonic lethality in DNMT1-null mutant mice indicates that DNA methylation is essential for mammalian embryonic development [9]. Animal studies and human data on the imprinted IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) locus indicated a link between prenatal nutrition and DNA methylation, and persistent changes in DNA methylation may be a common consequence of prenatal famine exposure [10]. Above all, the change in DNA methylation pattern caused the disorder of development, leading to birth defects. However, abnormal methylation in NTDs with folate-associated dysmetabolism has not been reported.

This study investigated the mechanism of methylation changes in methotrexate (MTX) induced NTDs for the first time, which is of great importance to elucidate the exact mechanism between folate deficiency and NTDs.

Results
MTX-Induced NTDs and Embryonic Abnormalities
All embryos were examined carefully using a dissecting microscope. MTX caused a NTD incidence of 30.8%. The details of the types of other abnormalities and the folate-associated dysmetabolisms caused by MTX have been described previously [11, 12].

Concentrations of folates in embryonic tissues
To confirm the effect of MTX injection, folate contents were detected by UPLC/MS/MS. The concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MeTHF), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-FoTHF) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in embryonic neural tube tissues were significantly decreased (P<0.05) and the concentrations of folic acid, homocysteine (Hcy), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were significantly increased compared to control embryonic neural tissues (P<0.05) (Table 1).

DNA hypomethylation in NTDs
To determine whether DNA methylation was affected by folate metabolic disorder, we measured the global DNA methylation in neural tube tissues from control and NTDs by Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We observed that neural tube tissues had significantly decreased global DNA methylation levels compared to control (P<0.05) (Fig. 1).

Identification of differentially methylated genes
Samples in each group had three biological replicates. NimbleScan software was used to screen the differentially methylated regions. According to the criterion of cutoff limitation that Minimum Probes per peak is 2, P-value minimum cutoff (-log10) is 2, Maximum spacing between nearby probes within peak (bp) is 500bp, Sliding window width (bp) is 750. A total of 132 differentially methylated regions (35 low methylated regions and 97 high methylated regions) were selected from the two groups. Log2Ratio means value showed the methylated fold change between the two groups. The greater the Log2 ratio means value, the higher the credibility of the results. In our study, differentially methylated genes were showed in the Fig. 2, log2 ratio means values are relatively large in hypomethylation (red dots), the maximum is 1.1467, the minimum is 0.2767, and log2 ratio means values are relatively small in hypermethylation (blue dots), the maximum is 0.3567, the minimum is 0.0933. When the log2 ratio means values ≥0.5, the altered methylated region was considered as a high reliability change. So we only selected the log2 ratio means values ≥0.5 as the candidate peak for further analysis, and 26 peaks including 30 genes were selected in low methylated regions and found on Chromosome X.

Log2 ratio means: all probe average of peak area of three NTD samples, red dot represents the area of low methylation NTDs vs control, blue dot represents of high methylation NTDs vs control. The threshold line is the cutoff value, as the log2 ratio means values = 0.5. The numbers on the horizontal axis indicate the sorting number of genes. We did the sorting according to the numerical value of log2 ratio means. The sorting number of related genes showed as S1 Fig.

The selected genes were then analysed in the context of GO analysis using MAS3.0 (http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/mas3/). As shown in Fig. 3, they are divided into three categories including biological processes, molecular function and cellular components. The molecular function category mainly consisted of three subcategories: catalytic activity, binding and transcription regulator activity. In the biological process category, genes related to cellular process, metabolism and developmental process were found. KEGG analysis of the selected genes was also performed to identify potential novel candidates that are thought to be related to the NTD characteristics. After mapping the selected genes to KEGG, 42 pathways were involved (Fig. 4). Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of neural tube, Siah1b, Prkx in Wnt signaling pathway were prioritized.

Effect of MTX on Gene methylation
In the previous microarray study, we found the hypomethylation of Siah1b (ChrX:160513241–160516941), Prkx (ChrX:75040559–75044259). To confirm this results, we measured methylation level of Siah1b (ChrX:160513241–160516941), Prkx(ChrX:75040559–75044259) promoter sequences in embryonic neural tube tissues from both NTDs and control samples. Those sequences were amplified from 3 NTDs and 3 control samples after bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA. The mean methylation levels were then compared by using Student’s T test. The methylation levels in the NTD samples were significantly lower than that in the control samples (Fig. 5A, P<0.05).The results were consistent with microarray assays.

Furthermore, we performed quantitative real time PCR to compare the copy numbers of Siah1b, Prkx genes. Our results showed that there was no differences between NTDs and control (Fig. 5B, P>0.05).

To determine whether the abnormal Siah1b, Prkx methylation levels results in the expression of two genes, quantitative real time PCR was used to detect their expressions. We found the expression levels of the two genes were higher in NTDs than control (Fig. 5C, P<0.05).

Discussion
In this study, we observed the folate dysmetabolism and global DNA hypomethylation in embryonic neural tube tissues of NTDs. Furthermore, microarray was used to identify differentially methylated genes in the embryonic neural tissues of NTDs induced by MTX associated with folate-dysmetabolism in pregnant mice compared to controls. A total of 132 differentially methylated regions (35 low methylated regions and 97 high methylated regions) were selected from the two groups. Genes in Wnt pathway (Siah1b, Prkx) were confirmed by quantitative real time PCR. These two genes might contribute to the pathogenesis of MTX-induced NTDs on the basis of hypomethylation at the epigenetic level.

MTX is a specific inhibitor to DHFR, an essential enzyme in the folate metabolic pathway, leading to the failure of folate being reduced to tetrahydrofolate and thus folate-related dysmetabolism. In our study, we injected MTX into pregnant mice, which resulted in a decreased level of one-carbon unit in the embryonic neural tube tissues of NTDs. The concentrations of 5-MeTHF, 5-FoTHF, and SAM were significantly decreased, and the concentration of Hcy and SAH was increased significantly. These results further support the notion of a close association between folate metabolic disorders and NTDs.

Aberrations in genome-wide methylation during embryogenesis have been linked to developmental abnormalities at birth[13]. Several reports showed that inhibition of the methylation cycle induced a high frequency of cranial NTDs in cultured chick and mouse embryos [14–16]. Those suggest that aberrant genomic methylation underlies the complex pathogenesis of NTDs. In this study, we found that global methylation levels were significantly lower in embryonic neural tissues of NTDs. DNA hypomethylation increases recombination and/or hamper chromosomal segregation during mitosis[5, 17], which may play a role in the development of chromosome abnormalities in NTDs and shed some light on the mechanisms involved in the cause of NTDs.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification, which play an important role in maintaining chromosome structure, X chromosome inactivation, gene imprinting and tumor development[18]. In the embryonic development at E3.5 day, the overall methylation level begin to increase, and achieve higher level at E6.5 day. The higher methylation level was maintained until birth [19]. The methylation level of the promoter CpG islands may affect the gene transcription regulation, and make the gene silence. It has been reported that methylation is involved in X chromosome inactivation [20]. In this study, we screened the differential methylated regions by the NimbleGen mouse DNA methylation microarray. Results showed that 35 low methylation regions and 97 high methylation regions were found. When the log2 ratio means values ≥0.5, 26 peaks including 30 genes were selected in low methylated regions. The altered methylated region was considered as a high reliability change. The selected genes were then analysed in the context of GO biological process using MAS3.0 to select the NTD candidate genes. 2 genes in Wnt pathway were selected as good candidates for further investigation. The 2 genes expression profiling and copy number were detected by real time quantitative PCR which showed that the 2 genes exhibited upregulated expression in NTD embryonic neural tissues compared to that in control embryonic neural tissues. Besides, the copy numbers of Siah1b, Prkx genes showed no difference between NTDs and control embryonic neural tissues. Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of neural tube. It’s not only involved in the formation of dorsal and ventral axis of embryo, but in the developmental events of the establishment of cell polarity, cell fate decisions et al. Siah1b is one of the seven in absentia homolog (Siah) family. Overexpression of Siah1 can mimic the effects of p53 activation and induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis [21–23]. The expression of Siah1b is induced by p53 during apoptosis and tumor reversion, and the Siah1b gene is a direct transcriptional target of p53 [24, 25]. Prkx encodes a serine threonine protein kinase that has similarity to the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP dependent protein kinases, and regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration[26], and Prkx has been suggested to play important roles in neuronal differentiation [27]. Therefore, we speculate that the change of Siah1b, Prkx genes methylation give rise to the abnormal expression of Siah1b, Prkx, eventually lead to NTDs. However, the exact effects of the 2 candidate genes need to be studied further and may offer insights into the mechanisms underlying NTDs.

In conclusion, hypomethylation of genomic DNA and the genes (Siah1b, Prkx) in Wnt signal pathway is one of the possible epigenetic variations associated with the complex etiology of NTDs. Folate and its related dysmetabolisms influence the process of genomic DNA methylation. Abnormal methylation caused the change of gene expression, induced cellular misbehavior, including apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation, led to the occurrence of NTDs. In this study, it provided the preliminary theoretical and experimental basis to further reveal the mechanism of NTDs induced by folic acid metabolic disorder. Howerver, there was limitation for the mice model of NTDs. As results showed in our study, 20% of murine embryos were resorbed following MTX treatment at 4.5mg/kg body weight [12]. This means that the fetuses we examined from the MTX-treated mothers represented a select subset of all the fetuses, which may bias ours results. The exact mechanism concerning the relationship of abnormal methylation with NTDs induced by folate dysmetabolism needs to be further clarified.

Materials and Methods
Establishment of NTD mice model by MTX
All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics (CIP2009012). NTD mice model was established by intraperitoneal injection of MTX (4.5mg/kg body weight) on gestational day 7.5 (GD7.5) into pregnant mice according to our previous study [11, 12]. MTX injection induced no significant weight loss in the mother compared to control on gestational day 11.5 when they are sacrificed. All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering of mice. The mice were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose. Embryonic neural tissues from the most rostral aspect of the forebrain to the caudal aspect of the hindbrain (above the otic vesicle) were microdissected and checked to eliminate any mesoderm or non-neural tissues as precisely as possible. The location from which the sample of the neural tube was obtained was consistent in all fetuses as precisely as possible. The sample of neural tube was obtained from the animals with exencephaly and without other malformation under a dissect microscope.

Detection of folate contents in embryonic tissues
Embryonic tissue samples were homogenized with extraction buffer (0.05mol/LMES,0.1mol/L DET, 1% sodium ascorbate, pH6.0), heat extracted at 100°C for 15min and centrifuged for 15min at 36000×g. Conjugase from folate-free rat plasma was added to the supernatant and incubated at 37°C for 1.5h. The samples were then heated at 100°C for 5min, and centrifuged for 20 min at 36000×g [28]. The supernatant were detected using UPLC/MS/MS methods following the previous description[29].

DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted from three control and three NTD samples, respectively, according to manufacturer’s instructions of DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). The genomic DNA should be undegraded and have A260/A280≥1.8 and A260/A230≥1.9 according to NimbleGen quality control requirements.

Global methylation analyses by LC-MS/MS[30]
An Agilent tandem mass spectrometer (G6410B) was used for LC-MS/MS analysis. Separation was performed on an Aglient ZORBAX SB-AQ C18 column (2.1×100 mm, 3.5μm). The mobile phases were set as follows: methanol (phase A) and water (phase B), both with 0.1% formic acid. The following linear elution gradient was used (flow rate, 0.2 ml/min): 0–2min, 100%A to 95%A; 2–2.5min, 95%A to 90%A, 2.5–3.5min, 90%A to 75%A; 3.5–7.5min, 75%A to 100%A, 7.5–10min, equilibration with 100%A. The total analysis time was 10 min and the injection volume was 10μL. The MS/MS phase of analysis was performed under positive-ion (ESI) mode. The parameters for ESI source were a gas temperature of 350°C, dry gas flow of 12 L/min, nebulizer pressure of 50 psi, and capillary voltage of 4000V. High purity nitrogen (purity>99.999%) was used as collision gas and ordinary nitrogen was used as nebulizing gas. Quantification of the deoxyribonucleosides was accomplished in multiple reactions monitoring mode (MRM).

DNA methylation analyses using DNA methylation microarrays
The microarray analysis for six extracted DNA samples was performed using NimbleGen mouse DNA methylation 3×720K CpG islands plus refseq promoter arrays according to the manufacturer’s instructions (http://www.nimblegen.com/support/dna-microarray-support.html).

Methylation measurement and analysis
Genomic DNA from NTD and control samples were treated with sodium bisulfite and purified by using the Wizard DNA Clean-Up System. The quality of the bisulfite conversion was controlled using PCR products without methylation.

The Sequenon MassARRAY platform was used to analyze the quantitative methylation according to the previous study [5](S1 Table).

Confirmation Using Quantitative Real-time PCR
To confirm the microarray result, we used the same genomic DNA as in the microarray analysis for quantitative real-time PCR. Experiments were performed on an ABI prism7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) using Power SYBR Green. The primers were designed using Primer 3.0 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3) (S2 Table). Each assay was performed in triplicate using 20μL reactions containing 10μL 2×Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 200nM forward and reverse primers, and 20ng genomic DNA. Melting curve and sequence analysis were performed to verify PCR product specificity. The relative Ct method was used to quantify the copy number in NTD versus control samples. The Ct values for each set of triplicates were averaged and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The relative copy number for each sample was calculated using the 2▲▲Ct method.

Relative mRNA expression levels were determined by SYBR Green I kit (Biotechs,Changchun,China) according to the following conditions:1 cycle at 95°C for 10min, 50cycles at 95°C for 15s and 60°C for 1min.

Data reports were similar as those described above (S3 Table).

Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 software package (McGraw-Hill Inc., New York, NY). Folate contents concentrations were expressed as mean±standard deviation (s.d.) and examined by one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of quantitative real-time PCR were the average of triplicate reactions. Comparisons of copy numbers and gene expressions between control and NTD neural tissue samples were performed using Student’s t-tests and expressed as mean±standard deviation (s.d.). All P values were 2-sided, and P<0.05 was considered to be significant.

To determine whether newborn hearing screening in a well-baby nursery (WBN) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nursery: 1) meet three targeted, screening, referral, and diagnostic follow-up rates; 2) compare the average age of diagnosis for infants admitted to the WIN and NICU; and 3) determine prevalence of hearing loss in neonatal population; and 4) try to find a practical newborn hearing screening time algorithm to reduce refer rate in NICU

Materials and Methods
It examined 15,624 newborns in the WBN (13,676) and NICU (1948) screened for congenital HL using AABR. The variables analyzed in it were the screening rate, referral rate, follow-up rate, diagnostic rate and diagnostic age, prevalence rate, degrees of congenital bilateral HL. The study was approved by the hospital’s institutional review board (13MMHISO23).

Results
The screening rates were 99.8% and 99.6% in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively, without significant difference. The referral rates were 0.7% and 2.8% in the WBN and NICU groups, with significant difference. Furthermore, the diagnostic follow-up rates were 76.7% and 89.1% in the WBN and NICU groups, without significant difference. The average initial diagnostic ages were 1.9 months and 3.8 months in the WBN and NICU groups, with significant difference. The prevalence of congenital bilateral hearing loss were 0.27% and 1.6% in the WBN and NICU groups, with significant difference.

Conclusion
The screening, referral and follow-up rate in the WBN and NICU groups were equivalent to the quality indicators. For NICU group, screening and diagnostic follow up were performed later than those in WBN group; however the lower referral rate in our NICU group was successfully achieved in this study and can be applied clinically. The prevalence of congenital bilateral hearing loss was higher in the NICU group than in the WBN group.

Introduction
The importance of universal early screening, diagnosis, and intervention in reducing the negative impact of congenital hearing loss (HL) has been described extensively all over the world[1–5]. Mackay Memorial Hospital and the Children’s Hearing Foundation established the first pilot hospital-based program for newborn hearing screening in Taiwan in 19984. During 2003–2013, the following three major initiatives supported by the Bureau of Health Promotion were introduced to promote UNHS in Taiwan: (1) the establishment of “2004 The Guidance of Newborn Hearing Screening” (using otoacoustic emissions [OAE] or automated auditory brainstem response [AABR] examination, the expense of which was to be borne by the parents); (2) the establishment of “2008 Taiwan Newborn Hearing Screening Consensus Document” (using AABR examination, the expense of which was to be borne by the parents), which has three major goals, namely achieving a screening rate of >95%, a referral rate of <4%, and a diagnostic follow-up rate of >70%[6]; and (3) the establishment of “2014 Taiwan Newborn Hearing Screening Consensus Document”(a screening rate of >95%, a referral rate of < 2%, and a diagnostic follow-up rate of > 95%)[7] and the implementation of a free national UNHS program UNHS in 2012 (using only AABR examination to concisely reduce false-positive and false-negative findings; the costs of AABR examination are borne by the government, and the examination is therefore free of cost for parents). The age of identification and diagnosis of as well as interventions for congenital hearing-impaired children have decreased gradually since the government established the newborn hearing screening program in Taiwan[5].

In Taiwan, the national program for UNHS by using AABR examination, free of cost for citizens, was implemented in 2012 and then every Taiwanese newborn baby, including those in the well-baby nursery (WBN) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), should receive hearing screening before discharge from the hospital. In our previous studies[8–11], all babies who were screened for hearing impairment were from the WBN, not from the NICU, and were healthy. No study of UNHS in NICU babies has been conducted in Taiwan. In 2000, the U.S. Joint Committee on Infant Hearing recommended that NICU babies undergo hearing screening tests[12]. Connolly et al[13] reported that the incidence of congenital HL according to the high risk register was 1.2/1000 in BR babies and 13.3/1000 in NICU babies. Moreover, in one study, the incidence of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) in NICU babies was 24%, and screening them by using OAE examination resulted in false-negative findings[14]. In another study, OAE examination was affected by the environmental noise level in the NICU, which is usually higher than 60 dBA according to a statement issued by the ASHA[15]. Moreover, the U.S. NIH (1993) recommended that AABR, not OAE, examination be used as a hearing screening technique for babies with a high risk of HL according to the high risk register [16].

Study of UNHS in NICU babies has not been conducted before in Taiwan and several in other countries[17–19], however which showed much higher refer rate in NICU in U.S. of 4.9%[17], Dutch of 9.2%[18] and Brazil of 4.1%[19]. So, the aims of study were to assess whether the screening babies in the WBN and NICU using AABR enables achieving the three aforementioned goals[6–7], namely a screening rate >95%; a referral rate <4%; and a diagnostic follow-up rate >70% and compared the average age of congenital HL diagnosis as well as the prevalence of congenital HL between WBN and NICU babies. Finally, we try to find a practical newborn hearing screening time algorithm to reasonably reduce refer rate in NICU to prevent burden of audiology follow up and intangible cost including parental anxiety.

Materials and Methods
This retrospective cohort study examined well-baby nursery (WBN) and NICU babies at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei screened between February 2008 and December 2011 and was approved by the hospital’s institutional review board (13MMHISO23) with chairman of Yen-Ta Lu M.D. PhD. All patients records/information were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei is a big medical center in northern Taiwan, the birth babies come from more than 1/4 of total country population, and is the epitome of newborn hearing health care in Taiwan. A total of 15,624 newborns (WBN, 13,676; NICU, 1948) underwent screening for congenital HL through AABR examination (ALGO 3i, Natus Medical Inc. San Carlos, CA USA). There was none with craniofacial anomaly in WBN group. Two experienced (> 10 years work) full-time nurses were involved in the initial hearing screening program. In Taiwan, the medical care system allows only 3 days postnatal hospitalization for a healthy newborn. The appropriate time for performing hearing screening is considered to be 48 hours postnatal. NICU babies with several health problems and hearing impairment are easily affected by environmental noise in the NICU. Consequently, screening NICU babies for HL is more difficult than screening WBN babies; NICU babies undergo hearing screening after their condition stabilizes and they are moved to the newborn center (NBC). Babies fail to pass initial AABR screening undergo a second AABR screening before their discharge. However, if they fail to pass the second AABR screening, they should undergo complete hearing diagnostic assessment.

In this study, the initial diagnostic hearing tests were TEOAE, click-Auditory Brainstem Response, and tympanometry. For babies aged 1 month who required further assessment, diagnostic ABR testing was performed using an Air Conduction click stimulus. Babies were considered to have sufficient hearing sensitivity for the development of speech and language if bilateral ABR threshold searching at 20 dB normalized hearing level (dB nHL) showed the presence of a Wave V. Babies were considered to have normal hearing if they fulfilled the pass criteria for both TEOAE and ABR examinations. For babies who failed to pass the initial ABR or OAE examination, a second diagnostic hearing test involving tone-burst ABR measurement (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz), Auditory Steady State Response, and tympanogram was conducted.

Babies who failed to pass the second stage of tone-burst ABR or ASSR testing received behavioral hearing tests (including behavior observation audiometry for those aged < 6 months and visual reinforcement audiometry or those aged 6–30 months). HL at a VRA or ABR threshold of 25–39 dB nHL was defined as mild, HL at a threshold of 40–69 dB nHL was considered moderate, HL at a threshold of 70–89 dB nHL was defined as severe, and HL at a threshold of ≥90 dB nHL was considered profound. HL was defined as bilateral asymmetrical when the difference in the hearing threshold between the ears was >15 dB HL, and the degree of bilateral asymmetrical HL depended on the ear with milder HL. Parent counseling and fitting of the hearing aid were arranged for the babies with confirmed bilateral HL.

SPSS 19.0 and the chi-square test were used to analyze and compare the hearing screening performance between the WBN and NICU babies. The independent t test was used to compare the screening age and diagnostic age of HL.

Results
Between February 2008 and December 2011, a total of 15,624 newborns (WBN, 13,676; NICU, 1948) were screened for HL at Mackay Memorial Hospital (a tertiary medical center), Taipei, Taiwan. Of the 13,676 babies in the WBN group, 13,645 were screened for HL, representing a hearing screening coverage rate of 99.8%; of the 1948 babies in the NICU group, 1941 were screened for HL, representing a hearing screening coverage rate of 99.6%. The chi-square test showed no significant difference between the groups (X2 = 1.237 (df = 1, p = 0.266), p > 0.01). Of the 13,676 babies in the WBN group and 1948 babies in the NICU group, 13,603 and 1734 underwent early screening (before 1 month), accounting for rates of 99.7% and 89.3%, respectively. The chi-square test showed a significant difference between the groups (X2 = 1183.735 (df = 1, p = 0.000), p < 0.01). The average ages of hearing screening were 2.12(±0.5) days and 13.05(±2.6) days in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (F-test = 4841.990 (p = 0.000), t = −22.489 (df = 1958.292,p = 0.000), p < 0.01). It meant NICU babies received later hearing screening due to unhealthy state.

Fig 1 shows that the total hearing screening referral rate was 0.9% (0.7% and 2.8% in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively). The chi-square test showed a significant difference of referral rate between the WBN and NICU groups (X2 = 87.139 (df = 1, p = 0.000), p < 0.01).

The chi-square test showed a significant difference of referral rate between the BR and NICU groups (X2 = 87.139 (df = 1, p = 0.000), p < 0.01).

The overall return-for-follow-up rate after failure of hearing screening in both groups was 81.4% (118/145). Fig 2 shows the rates to be 76.7% (69/90) and 89.1% (49/55) in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between the WBN and NICU groups (X2 = 3.478 (df = 1, p = 0.062), p > 0.01).

There was no significant difference between the BR and NICU groups (X2 = 3.478 (df = 1, p = 0.062), p > 0.01)babies.

A total of 118 babies (WBN, 69; NICU, 49) underwent complete diagnostic hearing assessment after being referred for hearing screening(Fig 3). In the WBN group, the diagnostic age of follow up was <1 month in 2 babies, 1–2 months in 52 babies, 2–3 months in 8 babies, and >3 months in 7 babies. In the NICU group, the diagnostic age of follow-up was <1 month in 1 baby, 1–2 months in 14 babies, 2–3 months in 7 babies, and >3 months in 27 babies. For the 118 babies who underwent diagnostic follow-up, the average age of diagnostic hearing assessment was 2.7 months; the age was 1.9 and 3.8 months in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively, exhibiting a significant difference (F = 11.697, p = 0.001; t = −4.066, p = 0.000). It revealed NICU babies received later hearing confirmed diagnosis due to later initial screening.

Discussion
This study included 15,624 (WBN, 13676; NICU, 1948) newborns screened for HL impairment using AABR. The hearing screening coverage rates were 99.8% (WBN, 13645/13676) and 99.6% (NICU, 1941/1948) in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively. In the WBN group, 31 babies did not undergo hearing screening (30 died; for 1, no test result was available); in the NICU group, 7 babies did not undergo hearing screening because of poor health conditions. The hearing screening coverage rate close to 100% observed in our study was also evident in another study conducted in Taiwan[9] and the U.S. [20]. The near 100% of coverage rate were achieved because of the implementation of the free national UNHS program in Taiwan in 2012 [9].

Fig 1 shows that the hearing screening referral rates were 0.7%, 2.8%, and 0.9% in the WBN group, NICU group, and both groups, respectively. Our study showed a higher hearing screening referral rate in the NICU group than in the WBN group, which results were similar to those observed in Dutch by van Dommelen[18] and van der Ploeg[21]. Connolly et al[13] reported that the high risk register factors for congenital deafness were observed in 1.2/1000 and 13.3/1000 babies in WBN and NICU groups, respectively. However, our referral rate in NICU was 2.8%, much lower than 4.9% by Mason Herrmann[17] NICU study in U.S., in which their refer rate was 4.9%(68/1401) using AABR and infants were screened at age of 2 days to 90 days, but no description of its average screening time. Our 2.8% referral rate was also much lower than 9.2% by van Dommelen [18] NICU study in Dutch, in which their refer rate was 9.2%(2933/32038) using AABR and 95.8% of infants were screened < 1 months, but without mention of its average screening time. Additionally, in one Brazil study[19], their refer rate was 4.1% using after twice AABR screening without statement of its average screening time. These three above studies seemed to that higher referral rate in NICU than us were observed in developed and developing countries. The more reasonable lower referral rate in our NICU study could be attributed to be a little late time set for hearing screening when infants were transferred to NBC with an average time of 13 Days, speculated to be late than the above three studies[17–19]. The second probable reason for lower referral rate in our NICU group could be attributed to our hearing screener with well experienced (> 10 years work) full-time nursery background.

Fig 2 shows that the total return-for-follow-up rate was 81.4% (118/145), and the rates for the WBN and NICU groups were 76.7% (69/90) and 89.1% (49/55), respectively. However, this difference was non-significant. Of the 21 babies who were lost to follow up in the WBN group, 18 babies with unilateral referral and 3 with bilateral referral. Upon being contacted for telephone counseling years later, the parents of the 3 babies with bilateral referral reported that their children had no hearing problems on the basis of their daily activity. Therefore, the reason for the lower follow-up rate in the WBN group could be the neglect of potential hearing problems because the babies had a unilateral hearing referral. Nursing personnel involved in UNHS should conduct more parents counseling to prevent loss to follow up for unilateral hearing examination in WBN babies. Of the 6 babies who were lost to follow up in the NICU group, 3 received a unilateral referral and 3 received a bilateral referral. Upon being contacted for telephone counseling years later, the parents of the 3 bilateral referral babies refused to talk about their children’s hearing behavior.

In the 118 babies who were followed up, the average age of diagnostic hearing assessment was 2.7 months in both groups, 1.9 months in the WBN group, and 3.8 months in the NICU group (Fig 3). The results showed a significant difference between the groups, indicating that there was a delay in the age of diagnostic hearing follow-up assessment in the NICU group(3.8 months) compared with the WBN group(1.9 months). In addition, 78.3% of referred babies in the WBN group received diagnostic hearing follow-up assessment at the age of <2 months, and 55.1% of the referred babies in the NICU group received this assessment at the age of >3 months (Fig 3). These results are similar to those observed by Mason and Herrmann[18]. The major reason for the delay of diagnostic hearing follow-up assessment in the NICU group was poor health conditions.

Fig 4 shows that, of the total 118 babies referred after the complete hearing diagnosis follow up, 17 had normal hearing, 33 had unilateral HL, and 68 had bilateral HL. Of the 69 WBN babies referred after the complete hearing follow up, 11 had normal hearing, 21 had unilateral HL, and 37 had bilateral HL. Of the 49 NICU babies referred after the complete hearing follow up, 6 had normal hearing, 12 had unilateral HL, and 31 had bilateral HL. Of the 33 babies with unilateral HL, 21 and 12 were in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively. Of the 68 babies with bilateral HL, 37 and 31 were in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively.

The average age of confirmed hearing diagnosis in 68 babies with bilateral HL was 9.8 months (4–36 months). In our study, bilateral asymmetrical HL was considered to occur when the difference in the hearing threshold between the ears was >15 dB HL. The incidence of bilateral asymmetrical HL was higher in the NICU group than in the WBN group, although it showed no significant difference between the two groups.

Fig 5 shows the distribution of the degrees of HL in the 68 babies who were confirmed to have bilateral HL. The incidence of mild to moderate HL was higher in the WBN group than in the NICU group. Conversely, the incidence of severe to profound HL was higher in the NICU group than in the WBN group. The greater distribution of cases of moderate and profound bilateral HL in our study was consistent with the results of Mason and Herrmann [18].

The prevalence of bilateral congenital HL among the babies in both groups was 0.44% (0.27% in WBN and 1.6% in NICU groups, respectively), which is higher than that in our previous study (0.13%–0.16%)[8,11]. These two our results were different because, in this study, hearing screening was performed in both the WBN and NICU groups, but only in WBN babies were screened in our previous study[8,11]. In our study, the prevalence of bilateral congenital HL among babies in the WBN group was 0.27% (mild 0.12% vs. moderate–profound HL 0.15%), which is slightly higher than that of 0.07%–0.16% reported by studies conducted in Dutch[20], or U.S. [18]. The prevalence of bilateral congenital HL among the NICU group babies in our study was 1.6% (mild 0.62% vs. moderate–profound HL 0.92%); this prevalence rate is consistent with 1.7% of Van Dommelen study in Dutch[17] and that observed by Seewald and Tharpe[22], who reported that the prevalence of bilateral congenital deafness in NICU babies was approximately 0.8%−2.0%, which was 10 times higher than that in WBN babies.

The limitation of our study was that it was a cohort study conducted at a single medical center; in the future, studies should examine babies from multiple centers.

Conclusion
The hearing screening rates in the WBN and NICU groups were 99.8% and 99.6%, respectively, with no significant difference. The referral rates in the WBN and NICU groups were 0.7% and 2.8%, respectively, with a significant difference. The lower 2.8% hearing referral rate in our NICU group than before studies could be attributed to a little late time set for hearing screening or our hearing screener with experienced full-time nursery background. The diagnostic follow-up rates in the WBN and NICU groups were 76.7% and 89.1%, respectively, without significant difference. The average initial diagnostic ages in the WBN and NICU groups were 1.9 months and 3.8 months, respectively, with a significant difference. The prevalence rates of congenital bilateral HL in the WBN and NICU groups were 0.27% and 1.6%, respectively, with a significant difference. Importantly, we also concluded a well hearing screening time algorithm set at about 2 weeks in NICU could reduce referral rate (Fig 7).

We developed a map of the human footprint for the whole country and identified the ecological regions that have most transformed by human action. Additionally, we analyzed the extent to which (a) physical geography, expressed spatially in the form of biomes and ecoregions, compared to (b) historical geography, expressed as the spatial distribution of past human settlements, have driven the patterns of human modification of the land. Overall Mexico still has 56% of its land surface with low impact from human activities, but these areas are not evenly distributed. The lowest values are on the arid north and northwest, and the tropical southeast, while the highest values run along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and from there inland along an east-to-west corridor that follows the Mexican transversal volcanic ranges and the associated upland plateau. The distribution of low- and high footprint areas within ecoregions forms a complex mosaic: the generally well-conserved Mexican deserts have some highly transformed agro-industrial areas, while many well-conserved, low footprint areas still persist in the highly-transformed ecoregions of central Mexico. We conclude that the spatial spread of the human footprint in Mexico is both the result of the limitations imposed by physical geography to human development at the biome level, and, within different biomes, of a complex history of past civilizations and technologies, including the 20th Century demographic explosion but also the spatial pattern of ancient settlements that were occupied by the Spanish Colony.

==== Body
Introduction
Ecological patterns and processes are influenced by human activities in two main ways: directly, by the transformation of land into infrastructure and productive areas [1], or indirectly, through the byproducts of human activities that might disperse away from their causal source and degrade ecosystem functions [2]. Direct modifications of the land through human infrastructure (human settlements, transportation pathways, and power lines) and productive areas (agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, and cattle ranching) have increased globally during the last century as a result of accelerated human population growth [1,3,4].

Several studies have analyzed the patterns of direct human modification of the land surface as a proxy of human influence on natural ecosystems (e.g., [5–10]). Although human modification indices do not convey the entire human effect expressed as changes historically accumulated over natural ecosystems, they are useful to infer the spatial pattern and extent of the capacity of humans to transform the earth through land use [11]. Many studies analyze how diverse ecological regions have different capacity to respond to landscape transformations (e.g., [12,13]), but only a few of them (e.g., [14–16]) analyze how the physical geography (defined, for example, as biomes or ecoregions) affects the spatial patterns of human modification.

Mexico is an ecologically heterogeneous country that hosts a diverse array of ecosystems ranging from hyper-arid deserts to tropical rainforests, which have evolved as a consequence of both the country’s complex topography and its particular location between the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographic realms. Mexico is also one of the biologically megadiverse countries of the world, with high endemism for birds, mammals, and reptiles [17].

In principle, it would be expected that human developments and land transformations in Mexico follow the country’s complex environmental mosaic, with regions where environmental conditions are more favorable for human settlement and occupation (given a particular level of technological development) showing a larger human footprint. But land settlements and landscape transformations are not only the result of physical geography; there are also technological and historical components, linked to the ability of different societies to use different environments, which can be especially important to understand land-use change in regions that have harbored dense settlements for millennia [18,19,20]. This historic dimension is especially relevant in countries such as Mexico, with a long history of human occupation and well-documented civilization collapses. Indeed, despite the common misperception that Europeans found a New World that was largely unoccupied and wild, what Spaniards found in Mexico was a densely populated territory with well-developed agricultural settlements and large urban centers that heavily impacted their respective hinterlands. When Europeans arrived to Mesoamerica the population of the larger territory of what we now call Mexico was in the order of tens of millions of people [21,22,23]. Although the native population was devastated by European diseases, the encomienda system, and 16th Century droughts [24,25], its geographical distribution at the time of Spanish conquest conditioned the subsequent land occupation and landscape transformations. Even livestock husbandry developed initially in dryland agricultural areas that had been abandoned by the population collapse [26].

The ability of humans to transform the face of the earth has been referred to as the ¨human footprint.¨ In 2002 Sanderson et al. developed a geographically-explicit index that displays in map form the sum of all visible anthropogenic transformations on a large territory [6]. Sanderson et al.’s Human Footprint Index (HF) is calculated by adding all major large-scale anthropogenic transformations over the land surface. It uses four variables to summarize the effects of human modification: population density, land use change, access areas, and electric infrastructure. This index has been used and modified in different studies and at different scales (e.g., [9,27]), but always following the main idea that the intensity of human influence is the result of the type of activity, the area that each activity occupies, and the accumulation of activities within large areas [6,9]. Its values distributed on a map reveal the major patterns of human influence over the broad landscape [6–9,27]. The advantages of the HF index lie in the fact that it uses publicly available geographic data for the majority of countries and hence it is easily reproducible by different researchers in different regions [8,27,28], and its calculations are statistically simple, with an explicative clarity that can be easily understood [6].

In this study we present a map of the Human Footprint for Mexico, basically following the methodology of Sanderson et al. [6]. Our goals were manifold. Because Mexico is a country with a rich historical legacy and a prolific literature on its profound landscape transformations, we wanted first to analyze how much of a complex set of process and patterns that have been described mostly qualitatively coincided with the quantitative results of the Human Footprint approach. Secondly, we wanted to analyze how much of the variation in Human Footprint across the country is related to environmental variation at different scales, including (a) the effect of large-scale climate in biomes such as deserts or tropical rainforests, (b) the effect of different ecological regions within the large biomes, and (c) variation within ecoregions. Thirdly, we aimed at testing the power of the approach to identify the size and number of extant patches of well-preserved ecosystems that may inform future initiatives of biodiversity conservation. Finally, we analyzed how Human Footprint values correlate spatially with regions of historically-intense land use.

Methods
We selected spatial datasets that represent, as much as possible, all the different sources of direct human modification of the land surface: human settlements, cultivated land (agriculture, forestry plantations and cultivated grasslands), cultivated coasts (marine aquaculture) and roads.

Selection of databases and spatial resolution
We used digital vector maps from Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Geografía, Estadística, e Informática—INEGI), and complemented them with road maps from Mexico’s Institute of Transport (Instituto Mexicano del Transporte—IMT). INEGI’s [29] maps of land use and land cover (series III, at a scale of 1:250,000), were used to obtain spatial distribution of urban settlements, agriculture, aquaculture, forestry plantations, and cultivated grassland areas. The population numbers of non-urban settlements (<2500 persons) were included based on the 2010 INEGI’s population census. Major roads, highways, and local dirt roads were obtained from two sources: (a) the Mexican Institute of Transport digital road map [30], and (b) the ESRI Mexican roads database [31], both at a scale 1:200,000. In order to reduce the risk of small-scale mapping errors we chose an analytical resolution of 500 m (a cell of 500 m × 500 m).

To map urban areas and population clusters we used vector data from INEGI’s [29] land use and land cover map selecting all those areas identified as corresponding to urban settlements (>2500 people). Data for smaller, non-urban settlements (<2500) were generated from the 2010 INEGI Census, which displays information as “locations” (data-points inhabited by one or more households) with the number of people living in it.

Assignment of scores
Human modification at any given location is defined by two factors: intensity and extent [9]. Intensity is the degree to which an activity at a location has transformed the original ecosystem. We incorporated the intensity factor through the assignment of scores to the sources of direct human modification. Extent measures the aerial extension of the human activity at a specific location. We incorporated the extent through a threshold decision: due to our resolution level (500 m) and the difficulty to rigorously estimate the areal extent of each human transformation inside each cell, we used a presence/absence criterion in each pixel, considering an activity as present in a cell if it occupied at least half of the cell.

To map an index of population density we selected all urban areas as high population-density areas and gave them a maximum score of 10 (Table 1). Smaller locations, which appear as a point in the map, were ascribed to a single grid cell. Cells with more than 2500 inhabitants were lumped within the urban category; cells with 500–2500 inhabitants received a score of 7, while cells with less than 500 inhabitants received a score of 5.

10.1371/journal.pone.0121203.t001Table 1 Scores of human transformation.
Proxies	HT Score	
Urban	10	
Rural (500–2499 inhabitants)	7	
Rural (< 500 inhabitants)	5	
Agriculture	7	
Marine aquaculture	7	
Forestry plantations	5	
Cultivated and natural grasslands	5	
Paved roads	7	
Dirt roads	5	
The scores were assigned considering the irreversibility of the human transformation on the land surface and based on other published human footprint studies (e.g., [6,7,9,30,35]).

Other land use types (agriculture, cultivated grasslands, forestry plantations, and aquaculture) were extracted from INEGI’s land use and land cover map and each was saved as a separate layer. Following Sanderson et al. [6], we assigned a score ranging from 0 (low) to 10 (high) to each category of human transformation of the land surface (agriculture, cultivated or induced grasslands, roads, aquaculture, forestry plantations, and urban areas) based on the irreversibility of the transformation as used in other similar studies (e.g., [6,7,9,27,32]). Agriculture and aquaculture, for example, which destroy the native land cover but maintain some functionally in the substrate were given a score of 7, while cultivated grasslands and forestry plantations, which maintain a more permanent ground cover and some of the native flora, received a score of 5, and urban areas, which irreversibly destroy the native land cover and most of the soil substrate, received a score of 10.

Roads and transportation corridors were divided into two general categories that differ on their relative land modification: paved and dirt roads. Roads in the databases are represented in the original maps as elements of linear dimension, i.e., their area equals zero. We transformed them to areal dimensions generating a 250 m buffer on each side of paved roads, and 100 m on each side of dirt roads. Based on the different degree of land transformation of paved and dirt roads [33,34], we assigned a score of 5 to dirt roads that covered more than half of each grid cell, and 8 to paved roads (we did not include navigable rivers or railway lines in our analysis because they do not play a significant role as transportation corridors in Mexico). The number of lanes and traffic density of roads were not included in the calculation of our scores, as that information is not available in the databases we consulted.

Overall estimate of direct human modification
To calculate the overall effect of land use and infrastructure, we converted all vector maps with the different human sources of land transformation to a raster format with a pixel size of 500 m × 500 m, with their respective human modification scores for each pixel. According to our threshold criterion, only one activity can be present in each cell, except for roads, to which we allow their overlapping with the rest of activities. Therefore, roads might coexist within a single pixel with other forms of land transformation, and adding all layers could potentially exceed the maximum score of 10. In practical terms, this means that roads necessarily have a different additive effect on the footprint within a given cell: In a pristine, little transformed ecosystem the impact of a new dirt road will be much higher than the impact of a similar road in, say, a grazed grassland.

In order to address this problem we used Theobald’s [9] fuzzy algebraic sum of human transformation scores to reduce errors due to partial dependence between layers that can coincide in the same pixel. This method first rescales the scores on a scale from 0 to 1 assuming that pixels with more than one layer should have higher human modification than those pixels with only one layer. Thus, the overall value of direct human transformation HTi (on a scale from 0 to 1) at each pixel i is calculated as HTi=1−∏j=19(1−hij), where hij represents the human modification score of each individual source j present in pixel i. The values of HTi range between 0 and a maximum of 1, imposing a realistic upper limit to the added HT values. Finally, we re-scaled to range between 0 and 10 for our presentation.

The human footprint map
Finally, we smoothed the map for pixel neighborhood effects, averaging the value of each cell with those of its direct neighbors (i.e., a 3 × 3 cell neighborhood moving average algorithm). We defined the resulting map as the human footprint, an estimate of the spatial patterns of the direct human modification on Mexico’s land surface with quantitative scores HFi ranging from 0 to 10 for each pixel i, where zero represents an extremely low level of direct modification of land and 10 represents areas where maximum accumulation of human transformation have occurred. It is important to have in mind that under this moving average algorithm the value of 0 in a cell requires that all neighboring cells also had a value of 0.

Physical geography and the human footprint
We used the map of ecological regions of North America [35], officially used by INEGI in Mexico. Level I in this map defines large-scale regions based on broad continental-wide patterns of physical geography, climate, and vegetation physiognomy, similar in scale and scope to the ecological concept of biomes. Level II is hierarchically nested within level I and provides ecoregional subdivisions within the larger biomes in terms of distinct sub-continental traits in local physiography, biogeographic history, and biodiversity and endemism [35]. For our study, we modified the level II map in order to achieve the same cartographic detail in the Mexican drylands as in the rest of the country by separating the Warm Deserts category into three distinct ecoregions: Sonoran Desert, Chihuahuan Desert, and Potosí High Plateau (Altiplano Potosino). We explored how the physical geography (expressed in the ecoregions and biomes maps) influences the geographical pattern of the human footprint. To characterize the geographical pattern of HF we calculated: (a) the statistical distribution properties (mean, standard deviation, and skewness) of the human footprint within each ecoregion and each biome, and (b) the mean patch size and percentage of areas within each ecoregion with minimal direct human influence (HF = 0), as an indicator of the size of large continuous areas with extant native vegetation cover. Finally, we decomposed the overall variance in the human footprint into three ANOVA components: (a) variance explained by differences in HF between biomes, (b) variance explained by differences in HF between ecoregions nested-within-biomes, and (c) residual variance, or variance within ecoregions. Because the pixel-level information had been averaged with that of its eight neighbors (except in coastal pixels where the number of neighbors is lower), we conservatively took the total number of 3 × 3 grid cell units as our degrees of freedom for the ANOVA analysis (i.e., that is, although the original rasterized map has 7 793 854 grid cells, we took our degrees of freedom as 865 984).

Pre-Hispanic settlements and the human footprint
Finally, we tested whether there was a spatial association between the presence of ancient pre-Hispanic settlements and the modern human footprint. In order to do this, we first downloaded the coordinates of Mexico’s 183 main archaeological sites, compiled by the National Institute for Anthropology and History (INAH; http://www.geoportal.inah.gob.mx/). This list was complemented by the lists of major large pre-Hispanic settlements as identified by Kellog [36] for central Mexico, Sharer [37] for the Maya region, and Whitmore and Turner [38] for both. We overlaid this pre-Hispanic map on the ecoregional map of Mexico, and identified the ecoregions that harbored in the past many and large settlements. Then, using a t-test for comparison among means, we tested the hypothesis that ecoregions that had sheltered intense pre-Hispanic occupation show currently a higher mean HF value than those regions that did not harbor dense occupation (because the process involves multiple comparisons, the t-test probabilities were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction).

Results
General description of the human footprint in Mexico
Half of the country (55.9% of the total land surface) fell within the very low human footprint value (HF = 0), implying that over half of Mexico still maintains vegetation cover in reasonably good environmental conditions. Only 10.3% was classified within the very high footprint value (HF ≥ 7; Fig. 1). The remaining 33.8% belongs to intermediate values: low footprint (HF = 0.5–1) with 11.2% of the territory; medium (HF = 2–3) with 10.6%, and high (HF = 4–6) with 12%.

10.1371/journal.pone.0121203.g001Fig 1 Human footprint map.
The areas in black show with the highest human footprint values in a well-defined spatial pattern. They run along the coastal plains of the Gulf of Mexico and from there inland along an east-to-west corridor that follows the Mexican transversal volcanic ranges and the associated upland plateau. The areas in black represent the lowest values of human footprint located on Mexico’s arid northwest and its tropical southeast (chiefly the Yucatán peninsula).

The areas with the highest human footprint values show a well-defined spatial pattern (Fig. 1): They run along the coastal plains of the Gulf of Mexico and from there inland along an east-to-west corridor that follows the Mexican transversal volcanic ranges and the associated upland plateau. Areas of high footprint are also visible along the eastern coast of the Gulf of California. The rest of Mexico’s arid northwest and its tropical southeast (chiefly the Yucatán peninsula) present relatively low HF values. The country’s south (i.e., the region south of the transversal volcanic axis to the Pacific coast) harbors a fragmented mosaic of low and high footprint values.

Biomes, ecoregions, and the human footprint
The distribution of mean HF values in Mexico’s biomes and ecoregions is given in Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 2. The coastal Sierra Los Tuxtlas (an ecoregion within the Tropical Humid Forest biome where most of the original tropical forest has been cut to open way for pastures) showed the highest mean HF (4.74), while the Western Sierra Madre (within the Temperate Sierras biome) had the lowest mean HF value (0.52; see Table 2). Only two ecoregions, the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts, showed more than 80% of their total area falling within the low footprint category. On the other extreme, there were seven ecoregions that had a large proportion of their area in the high footprint categories (Table 2).

The standard deviation and the skewness of the HF distribution within each ecoregion are also given, together with the mean patch size (in km2) of very low-footprint areas (HF = 0) and the percentage of area with very low HF.

The mean HF value at the ecoregional level varied between 0.52 and 4.74, and large differences in ecoregional HF values were observed within most biomes (Table 2, and Fig. 3). Only the North American Deserts biome had most of its ecoregions with low mean HF values (0.53 for the Chihuahuan Desert, and 0.57 for the Sonoran Desert). The Mediterranean California biome has no ecoregional variation because it contains only one ecoregion in Mexico. The rest of the biomes showed marked differences in mean HF values between their ecoregions (Fig. 3). Except for the North American Desert biome and Mediterranean California, the rest of the biomes contained at least one ecoregion with HF > 3 (Table 2).

The statistical distribution properties of the HF values at the biome and ecoregional levels were similar and showed traits that are commonly observed in zero-bounded variables: On the one hand, the standard deviation of the HF values tended to increase with the mean footprint, until it leveled-off when mean HF reached a value of around 3 (Fig. 4a). Similarly, the skewness of the distribution was very high in low-footprint regions, and approached zero in the highest footprint values (Fig. 4b). That is, regions with low footprint values showed a strong J-shaped distribution, dominated by low-footprint areas but also harboring some small patches of high footprint sites such as cities or agricultural valleys. In contrast, as regional mean HF increases its distribution tends to become bell-shaped (skewness = 0), with low footprint and high-footprint areas distributed homogenously around the mean. This implies that even in regions showing the highest values of mean HF, the left tail of the distribution still harbors some small remaining areas with low HF.

(b) Relationship between mean human footprint in each ecoregion and the skewness of the distribution of footprint values (r2 = 0.87; P < 0.00001). (c) Relationship between mean human footprint and the mean patch size of low footprint area in each ecoregion (r2 = 0.84; P < 0.00001; in all cases the fitted curve was obtained using polynomial regression).

The ecoregions with the largest mean patch size (more than 100 km2) of low-transformed vegetation cover (HF = 0), are located in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts, Western Sierra Madre, Mediterranean California, and El Cabo. There was a negative relationship between the mean size of low footprint patches and the mean footprint (Fig. 4c). Low footprint ecoregions harbor both a higher total area (>70%) and larger continuous patches with HF = 0. In contrast, the mean patch size of HF = 0 within high-footprint ecoregions are less than 30% and 20 km2, respectively.

Decomposing the variance of the human footprint map into the effects of biomes and of ecoregions nested-within-biomes, we found that a significantly high amount of the variation in HF grid-cell values was accounted by fixed differences between biomes and between ecoregions within biomes (P < 0.0001 for both factors, see Table 3). The mean variance of the two levels did not differ significantly between them (F6,18 = 1.40, P = 0.27), indicating that variation between ecoregions within biomes is as large as between-biome variation.

Finally, we found seven ecoregions that harbored dense pre-Hispanic occupation and correspond to areas that were densely occupied before the arrival of Europeans to Mexico (Fig. 5). Two of them are in the Yucatan peninsula (Plain and Hills of the Yucatan Peninsula and Northwestern Plain of the Yucatan Peninsula) and five in central and southern Mexico (Interior Depressions, Gulf of Mexico Humid Coastal Plains and Hills, Transversal Neo-Volcanic System, Mexican High Plateau, Sierra Los Tuxtlas). To the latter list, we added the Coastal Plain and Hills of Soconusco, which, although not rich in large archaeological settlements, were an extremely important cacao agricultural area before Spanish occupation. We found a higher HF value in central and southern Mexico ecoregions (3.67, s.e. ±0.28) compared to the Yucatan (1.34, s.e. ±0.32) and to the rest of Mexico (1.73, s.e. ±0.29). Central and southern Mexico differed significantly from the other two regions (t = 5.5, P < 0.005; and t = 4.8, P < 0.003, respectively), but the mean HF in the Yucatán did not differ from that of the rest of Mexico (t = 0.38, P = 0.76; Fig. 5).

Discussion
Despite of the long history of human use in Mexico there is still a large amount of land in the country that maintains what appears to be vegetation cover that suffered relatively low impact from human activities (HF = 0), mostly in Mexico’s northern deserts and along the rugged ranges of the Western Sierra Madre. The arid, harsh climate of most of the northern drylands and the steep topography and sheer inaccessibility of the sierras explain in all likelihood the existence of large proportions of these areas with minimal apparent human footprint. The large difference in HF values between biomes, supports the hypothesis that physical geography is a major factor controlling the anthropogenic transformation of the ecosystems. Because biomes are defined as large units with similar broad patterns of physical geography, climate, and vegetation [39], biomes that are less transformed by human action correspond, plausibly, to large regions where land transformation is either difficult or unproductive, such as abrupt sierras or deserts.

At an ecoregional level, the highest footprint values were observed along the coastal corridor of the Gulf of Mexico, from the Texas Coastal Plain in the US border all the way south to the Humid Coastal Plains in Tabasco. From this coastal corridor, an inland transect of high-footprint ecoregions runs in a general E–W direction following the ranges of the Transversal Neo-Volcanic System and the associated uplands of the Mexican High Plateau. Lastly, an area of high human footprint is found running along the Pacific coast of southern Mexico in the Coastal Plains of the Soconusco, in Chiapas. Within a biome, ecoregions share a similar large-scale physical geography, climate, and plant physiognomy; differences between them lie on aspects of local physiography, biogeographic history, and biodiversity and endemism. However, we found that the ANOVA variation of ecoregions within-biomes is as important as that among biomes, a fact that supports our second hypothesis, namely that, at this scale, historical geography has played an important role in the transformation of the original land surface. For example, within the Tropical Humid Forests biome, the Plains and Hills of the Yucatan Peninsula have a mean HF value of 1.02, while the Sierra de Los Tuxtlas, one of the most intensely deforested regions of Mexico, has a mean HF value of 4.74, the highest for any ecoregion in the country (Table 2). Both areas have similar climate and vegetation, the main difference between them lies in their past histories of natural resource use and land clearing: While the Yucatan forests were depopulated after the collapse of the Classic Maya and have maintained relatively low population densities since, the Los Tuxtlas region suffered intense deforestation in the last century as a result of a growing demand for tropical agricultural land and pastures [40]. Similarly, within the Tropical Dry Forests biome the Sierras and Plains of El Cabo show one of the lowest footprint values of Mexico (HF = 0.64) while the Gulf of Mexico Dry Coastal Plains and Hills (often known as the Tamaulipan dry forests) have one of the largest (HF = 3.97). Similar vast differences between ecoregions that are climatically and geographically alike can be seen for most other biomes in Mexico.

The accelerated development of Mexico during the 20th Century partially explains this pattern: The coastal plains of the Gulf of Mexico harbor two large industrial areas (Monterrey in the north and Coatzacalcos in the south), Mexico’s largest ports, its oldest oil industry, and some of its most productive agricultural land. The inland transect of fertile basins and valleys that runs parallel to the transversal volcanic ranges harbors an urban chain of Mexico’s largest cities: Puebla, Mexico City, Toluca, Querétaro, León, Guanajuato, and Guadalajara, among others. The agricultural coastal plains of Sonora, Sinaloa, and Nayarit—cradle of Mexico’s “green revolution”—contain some of its most productive grain and produce fields. But an interpretation of these high footprint areas and of the human footprint pattern in Mexico based solely on a contemporary vision might be missing some potential causes of the spatial pattern of land use in the country.

Borah and Cook [22], and references therein, estimated the total pre-conquest population of what is now the Mexican nation in around 25 million. Although many researchers may sustain different estimates (e.g., [41, 42]), what is undoubtedly true is that when the Spaniards reached Mexico they found a densely inhabited territory and a highly transformed landscape [23] where somewhere between 10 and 25 million people lived (Fig. 6). Large, dense civilizations had risen and collapsed for millennia all over central Mexico, and had left behind their footprint on the environment in terms not only of large settlement centers, but also in terms of cleared land, terraced landscapes, irrigation systems, and transformed forests [38,43]. In the century that followed the Spanish conquest, the population of Mexico plummeted to around a million as the indigenous people succumbed to new diseases, wars with the Europeans, the collapse of local economies, and the encomienda system, in one of the most catastrophic population collapses known in history (Fig. 6) [44]. The demographic tragedy seriously affected agriculture and land use in Mexico; the cropping systems of the indigenous peoples could not be sustained with such losses in labor, leading to the abandonment of many cultivated landscapes [22] and opening the way for land appropriation by the Spanish of the depopulated land and the development of the hacienda system of large estates managed by the new ruling class [45].

Data compiled from Borah and Cook 1969, McCaa 2000, Benítez Zenteno 1961, and official population censuses available at www.inegi.gob.mx.

Much of the land that was once under indigenous cultivation was put to a new use (e.g., [26]). Although the crops and the agricultural techniques changed under Spanish rule, the occupation of the conquered territory followed the patterns of pre-Hispanic land use. Cattle and sheep production was introduced to the Gulf Coast by burning forest, wetlands, and former tropical orchards, altering indigenous agricultural landscapes to encourage the growth of grasses. Plantation crops emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, including sugarcane, first, followed later by cacao, cotton, and tobacco, all New World crops that found a fast growing demand in Europe during the Spanish Colony. Similar tropical-plantation development took place in the Soconusco region in Chiapas near the Guatemalan border, where the fertile coastal lowlands had been an important cacao-growing area in pre-Hispanic times (e.g., [46]), but underwent an explosive growth into the mountain slopes in the 19th and 20th Centuries, driven mostly by growing markets for cacao and coffee [47].

In central Mexico and the Gulf Coast there is a remarkable coincidence of highly impacted areas with the historic distribution of pre-Hispanic settlements and civilizations. As a general rule, the areas most transformed by human activities lie in the Gulf Coast and follow the E–W chain of cities along the central highlands, showing a marked spatial coincidence with the number of large pre-Hispanic settlements that existed at the time of Spanish arrival in Mexico in the early 16th Century.

In contrast, no significant spatial association was found in the Lowland Maya region of Yucatan between the footprint values of each ecoregion and the number of pre-Hispanic settlements in them. This apparent low footprint of past Maya civilizations has been analyzed in detail by Arturo Gómez-Pompa and his collaborators [48], who demonstrated that many forests of the Maya region are really a mosaic of remnants of ancient orchard-gardens, and that most of the Maya “wilderness” is really formed by new growth over old agricultural plots and tropical orchards, recolonized by forests after the collapse of the classic Maya a few centuries before the Spanish conquest.

Finally, in the country’s arid north a number of intensive processes of land-use change took place almost entirely during the 20th century to promote the development of new irrigation districts on the fertile alluvial plains of dryland rivers. Undertaken in the 1930s, shortly after the end of the Mexican Revolution, in large part to create new jobs and open new agricultural frontiers, the footprint of these massive projects is clearly visible in the low basin of the Nazas River in the heart of the Chihuahuan Desert; along the coast of Sonora and Sinaloa on the lowland plains of the Baluarte, Fuerte, Mayo, and Yaqui rivers; in the Mexicali Valley on the Colorado River deltaic plains; and on the Santo Domingo basin in Baja California Sur. It was basically modern technology—in the form of deep-well drilling, river dams, electrification, refrigeration and air conditioning—what allowed the colonization of these areas. Together with some industrial cities in Mexico’s northern ecoregions—such as Monterrey, Monclova, Torreón, Juárez, or Tijuana—these dryland areas of high human footprint are mostly the result of accelerated expansion during the 20th Century as the country’s development efforts started shifting towards its northern drylands.

Although, according to existing land-use maps, much of the low footprint dryland regions are classified as harboring native vegetation cover, these ecosystems have been used for centuries and many of them have suffered intense biological changes as a result [49,50]. Hidden anthropogenic change has been reported for the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts, where the introduction of cattle produced the invasive growth of native Opuntia cacti, changing the dominance structure of the native plant communities [51] but still allowing them to be seen by some as pristine or “wild”. The low HF values found for these ecoregions using map layers contrast with official statistics on rangeland degradation [50], where more than 50% of the area with native vegetation cover in the northern drylands is officially reported as overgrazed or impacted by cattle-induced shrub encroachment, a fact that highlights the large impact that the introduction of grazing animals from Europe brought to the region and how this impact is often hidden behind the apparent permanence of native vegetation. Thus, the method we used and the resulting map might be downplaying the true magnitude of anthropogenic transformations in the lower footprint categories. These hidden impacts on native ecosystems and biodiversity need to be considered in more detail in future research to be able to give a more accurate picture of the impact of anthropogenic influence on a region’s biological diversity and ecosystem services.

Finally, the Human Footprint algorithm was able to quantify with precision the size and location of continuous patches of (relatively) well-preserved ecosystems. Most of the large patches of low-transformed vegetation cover lie in Mexico’s arid north, where, not surprisingly, most of the new large protected areas decreed by the Federal Government during the last decades area found. The more anthropogenically-impacted ecoregions of central and southern Mexico harbor in general smaller patches of well-preserved vegetation cover, but, despite this, a number of these extant patches still can be found. The approach we are using in this analysis can inform and guide future efforts for conservation planning at a national level.

The human footprint model quantifies in detail patterns that are often known, or suspected, but not amenable to rigorous statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. The model was able to identify extant patches of relatively well-preserved vegetation that may inform future initiatives of biodiversity conservation. The model is also able to detect large expanses of land that have been severely transformed by human action but that harbor relatively low population densities, such as the irrigated arid farmlands in the coast of the Sonoran Desert, and may provide a tool to understand large-scale transformations of the environment that is substantially more powerful than, say, population density, distribution of urban areas, or analysis of land-use changes alone.

The spatial spread of the human footprint in Mexico is both the result of the limitations imposed by physical geography to human development at the biome level, and, within different biomes, of the environmental legacy of past civilizations and population collapses, including, but not exclusively restricted to, the 20th Century demographic explosion. Throughout Mexico, and very especially in the central part of the country, the current spatial distribution of highways, farms, and cities still reflects civilizations, technologies, and societal interactions of the past.

Here we studied the efficacy of neonatal porcine islet-like cell clusters (NPICCs) overexpressing LEA29Y, a high-affinity variant of the T cell co-stimulation inhibitor CTLA-4Ig, to engraft and restore normoglycemia after transplantation into streptozotocin-diabetic NOD-SCID IL2rγ−/− (NSG) mice stably reconstituted with a human immune system. Transplantation of INSLEA29Y expressing NPICCs resulted in development of normal glucose tolerance (70.4%) and long-term maintenance of normoglycemia without administration of immunosuppressive drugs. All animals transplanted with wild-type NPICCs remained diabetic. Immunohistological examinations revealed a strong peri- and intragraft infiltration of wild-type NPICCs with human CD45+ immune cells consisting of predominantly CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and some CD68+ macrophages and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. Significantly less infiltrating lymphocytes and only few macrophages were observed in animals transplanted with INSLEA29Y transgenic NPICCs. This is the first study providing evidence that beta cell-specific LEA29Y expression is effective for NPICC engraftment in the presence of a humanized immune system and it has a long-lasting protective effect on inhibition of human anti-pig xenoimmunity. Our findings may have important implications for the development of a low-toxic protocol for porcine islet transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Introduction
Transplantation of isolated islets or whole pancreas are currently the only treatment options to restore normal glucose homeostasis in patients with type 1 diabetes. The success of islet cell transplantation is limited by the shortage of organ donors, the need for transplantation of a large number of islets, and by side effects of immunosuppressive drugs1. Transplantation studies in non-human primates have shown that porcine islets are a promising alternative, almost unlimited cell source but face the problem of a strong xenoreactive rejection that requires an intensive immunosuppressive regimen with severe side effects, which impedes clinical application2–6. Systemic blockade of costimulatory pathways CD80/86-CTLA-4 and CD40-CD154 has emerged as a promising strategy to achieve control of allogeneic and xenogeneic graft rejection but is so far not applicable in clinical practice7, 8. We aimed to develop a method for local immunomodulation after islet xenotransplantation by transgenic (tg) overexpression of immunomodulatory molecules in porcine beta cells. Recently, our group generated a novel transgenic (tg) pig line expressing the CTLA-4Ig analogue LEA29Y under the control of the porcine insulin (INS) gene promoter. We demonstrated that transplanted INSLEA29Y-tg porcine neonatal porcine islet-like clusters (NPICCs) display normal beta cell function and are protected from rapid T lymphocyte-mediated rejection in NOD-SCID IL2rγ−/− (NSG) mice after the transfer of human PBMCs9. In this model, however, the observation period was restricted to 30 days due to the development of graft-versus-host disease and, therefore, the long-term effect of LEA29Y expression on xenograft rejection as well as the potential of NPICCs to engraft in the presence of an active human immune system remained unknown.

In the present study, we evaluated grafting and survival of INSLEA29Y-tg NPICCs in a humanized mouse model that allows both investigation of INSLEA29Y-tg NPICC engraftment and survival in the presence of a functional human immune system and long-term analysis of human anti-pig immune rejection.

Results
Reconstitution of human immune cells in NSG mice and immunological monitoring
Percentage of human immune cells during follow-up was determined by FACS analysis at weeks 16–20 and at the end of the study to confirm stable reconstitution with a human immune system throughout the observation period. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, there was a high percentage of human immune cells at both time-points (82 ± 12.3 before and 68 ± 24% hCD45+ cells after NPICC transplantation (peripheral blood) and 78 ± 18% hCD45+ cells in bone marrow). Among CD3+ T lymphocytes the majority belong to the CD4+ population with a CD4/CD8 ratio of about 2.6 (before transplantation). There were no differences in the proportion of human CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells between different transplantation groups.Figure 1 Reconstitution of human immune system and production of antibodies in NSG mice (HU-SRC-SCID) transplanted with wild-type (Tx-wt) or INSLEA29Y transgenic (Tx-LEA-tg) NPICCs. Isolated human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells were transferred to NSG mice. After 16–20 weeks and at the end of the observation period the percentage of human immune cells (hCD45+) and immune cell subsets (gated on human CD45) were analyzed by FACS (A). Xenoantibodies (B) and plasma levels of human IgG and human IgM (C) were measured by ELISA.




In addition, total plasma human immunoglobulin concentrations and the presence of xenoantibodies directed to the αGal epitope were analyzed at the end of the observation period. Significant plasma levels of human IgG (61 ± 31 µg/ml) and IgM (77 ± 35 µg/ml) were detectable. Concentrations of hIgM and hIgG were not different in animals transplanted with wild-type (wt) NPICCs and LEA29Y-tg NPICCs. Xenoantibodies directed to the αGal epitope were not detectable (Fig. 1B).

Development of normoglycemia in transplanted mice
NPICCs require an in vivo maturation period of 2–4 months until normal beta cell function is achieved9–11. To determine the capacity of LEA29Y expression to inhibit human immune cell-mediated beta cell rejection NOD-SCID IL2rγ−/− mice with >50% human CD45+ cells in peripheral blood (HU-SRC-SCID mice) were rendered diabetic by STZ treatment followed by transplantation with wt or LEA29Y-tg NPICCs. During follow-up of 4 months development of normoglycemia was observed in 70.4% HU-SRC-SCID mice transplanted with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs but in none of the animals transplanted with wt NPICCs (Fig. 2A,B) (p < 0.05). In the group transplanted with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs two additional mice developed near normal blood glucose levels (138–155 mg/dl) and only one mouse failed to improve hyperglycemia (Fig. 2B). As illustrated in Fig. 2B all mice transplanted with wt NPICCs showed persistent hyperglycemia requiring insulin treatment throughout the post-transplant period. The percentage of mice developing normal glucose homeostasis as well as time to reach normoglycemia after transplantation of LEA29Y-tg NPICCs was similar in HU-SRC-SCID mice (median 59.5 days; mean 62.7 ± 11.5 days) and in NSG mice which were not reconstituted with an immune system (grafting control NSG mice; median 42.0 days; mean 66.3 ± 13.5 days) (p = 0.86). Measurement of beta cell function in mice which achieved normoglycemia revealed normal glucose tolerance, similar blood glucose levels (area under the curve [AUCglucose] 10245 ± 1268 vs 9959 ± 583), and similar first phase insulin secretion (delta porcine insulin0–10 
min, 105 ± 59 pg/ml vs 74 ± 32 pg/ml) in both transplantation groups (Fig. 2C). Removal of graft-bearing kidneys (n = 3 mice) resulted in rapid reoccurrence of diabetes (BG >350 mg/dl) indicating that the graft was responsible for normal glucose homeostasis (Fig. 2B). In the other mice mouse C-peptide levels were below the detection limit at the end of the observation period. In addition, only few if any residual beta cells were detected in immunohistochemical stainings of recipient pancreata in both transplantation groups excluding endogenous beta cell regeneration (Supplemental Figure 1). Mean plasma concentration of LEA29Y measured at the end of the study was 0.344 ± 0.039 µg/ml.Figure 2 Transplantation of LEA29Y-tg neonatal porcine islet-like clusters (NPICCs) into diabetic NSG mice carrying a human immune system (HU-SRC-SCID). (A) Development of normoglycemia (random blood glucose levels consistently <120 mg/dl), blood glucose (C) response and insulin secretion (D) during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing was comparable in humanized Tx-LEA-tg and immunodeficient NSG mice transplanted with equivalent numbers of NPICCs. The 125-day time course of mice with LEA-tg NPICCs shows normalization of blood glucose levels in n = 5 mice, near normal glucose levels in n = 2 animals, and persistent hyperglycemia in n = 1 mouse (B). In contrast, all Tx-wt remained hyperglycemic (Log-rank test p = 0.039) (A,B). N = number of animals examined per group.




Histological analysis of graft infiltrating cells
Rejection of grafted porcine islets and NPICCs is associated with infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells2, 3, 5, 6, 9. There was a massive peri- and intragraft infiltration with human CD45+ immune cells into wt NPICC grafts 3–4 weeks after transplantation (Fig. 3). Most of the infiltrating cells were T lymphocytes (hCD3+) consisting of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations. Additionally, some cells stained positive for hCD68 (macrophages) or FoxP3 (regulatory T cells) (Fig. 3B) were observable. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, well preserved, strongly insulin positive endocrine tissue with only few infiltrating hCD3+, hCD4+, hCD8+ T cells and hCD68+ macrophages was detected in the group transplanted with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs. NK cells (h) were not detected in the subcapsular grafts in both transplantation groups (Supplemental Figure 2). The grafts of the 2 mice which developed near normoglycemia did not differ histologically from the grafts of normoglycemic mice (Supplemental Figure 3A,B). The graft of the mouse that failed to develop normoglycemia after transplantation of LEA29Y-tg NPICCs showed no insulin staining and only few immune cells (beta cell insulin score: 0; insulitis score: 1) suggesting either failure of primary grafting or complete rejection (Supplemental Figure 3C). Quantification of immune cell infiltrates in both transplantation groups revealed a significant lower insulitis score in mice transplanted with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). Figure 4A summarizes quantification of graft infiltrating immune cells. There were significantly higher numbers of T cells (hCD3+, hCD4+, hCD8+) per mm2 graft area and a trend towards an increased macrophage density in mice transplanted with wt NPICCs as compared to animals transplanted with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs (p < 0.05). To analyze whether FoxP3+ regulatory T cells are localized within the graft, the number of FoxP3+ cells was quantified and expressed in percent of the number of infiltrating CD4+ cells. The FoxP3+/CD4+ ratio was considerably higher in mice with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs but did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that expression of LEA29Y in beta cells strongly modulates und inhibits cellular human anti-porcine xenorejection.Figure 3 Histological analysis of transplanted NPICCs. Islet xenografts were investigated at day 30 and day 120 post Tx. (A) Staining for insulin (red) revealed that wild-type NPICCs were rejected and displayed a strong infiltration with human CD45+ (brown) immune cells. LEA29Y expressing islets were protected from rejection and exhibited a preserved islet xenograft with few infiltrating CD45+ cells. (B) Transplanted wild-type NPICCs at day 20–30 post Tx stained against insulin (red) and human CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, and FoxP3 (brown): only few insulin+ cells (arrows) are detectable but massive immune cell accumulation whereby infiltrating cells mostly consist of hCD4+ and hCD8+ lymphocytes, some macrophages, and few FoxP3+ T cells. Scale bar: 100 μm.

There was a non-significant trend towards a higher frequency of hCD68+ macrophages and a lower FoxP3+/CD4+ ratio in animals transplanted with wt NPICCs.

Long-lasting islet xenograft survival
In two normoglycemic mice transplanted with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs the follow-up period was extended to >6 months (29 and 34 weeks). Both mice exhibited persistent normoglycemia until the end of the study and a normal glucose tolerance. As illustrated in Fig. 5 the architecture of transplanted islets was well maintained and there were only single hCD45+ immune cells in the periphery of the grafted tissue. Thus, local LEA29Y expression has a long-lasting protective effect without the need of systemic immunosuppression.Figure 5 Long-term preservation of beta cell function in HU-SRC-SCID mice transplanted with LEA29Y expressing NPICCs. Xenograft was harvested 29 weeks post transplantation and stained for (A) human CD45 (brown) and insulin (red), (B) glucagon (brown) and (C) somatostatin (brown). Local LEA29Y expression preserved ICC structure and restricted human immune infiltration to the periphery of the transplantation site. Scale bar: 100 μm.




Discussion
The strong xenogeneic immune rejection is the major obstacle in pig-to-human islet transplantation. The striking advances in the generation of knock-out and transgenic pigs suggest that it may be possible to overcome the major immunological barriers within the next years12. Our approach is to overexpress immunomodulatory molecules in beta cells to provide a local immunosuppressive environment at the transplantation site. The present study demonstrated for the first time long-lasting survival of LEA29Y-tg porcine beta cells for more than 6 months in NSG mice carrying a stable human immune system without administration of additional immunosuppressive therapy.

Preclinical studies in non-human primates (NHP) reported on insulin independence and survival of transplanted wt porcine islets or islets expressing hCD46 using induction therapy with T cell depleting antibodies and high dose maintenance treatment with several combinations of immunosuppressive drugs2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14. All successful protocols included drugs blocking the second costimulatory signal in the interaction between antigen presenting cells (APS) and T cells. It is known that xenoimmunity is particularly dependent on CD80/86-CTLA-4 and CD40-CD154 signalling15, 16. Blocking the CD80/CD86 pathway by systemic administration of CTLA-4Ig or LEA29Y has been shown to efficiently inhibit effector T cell activation and proliferation, reduce porcine islet rejection, and does not adversely affect beta cell function2, 5, 6, 13, 14. In addition, prolonged survival of adenoviral vector transduced pig islets expressing porcine CTLA-4Ig has been reported17.

In the present study we used neonatal porcine islet-like cluster because NPICCs are thought to have some advantages over adult islets: 1) the isolation process of NPICCs is much easier and results in isolates of reproducible quality, 2) NPICCs are more robust against hypoxia and inflammation and breeding of transgenic piglets is much less expensive10, 18. This latter point may be of particular importance with regard to the translation of this cell therapy into the clinic. However, NPICCs are immature and require several weeks until insulin response to glucose is fully established10, 19. This limitation will be no major hurdle for future clinical application since T1D patients are on insulin treatment and can adapt insulin dose during the maturation period.

In a previous study we showed that LEA29Y-tg NPICCs were protected from rejection after transfer of human PBMCs indicating inhibition of T cell-mediated rejection9. In this model the follow-up period is restricted to about 30 days due to the development of a severe graft-versus host disease (GvHD). To overcome these limitations we here used an improved mouse model lacking GvHD, where the immune system is established by CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell transfer several months before islet cell transplantation. The HU-SRC-SCID model has been successfully used to establish mice with human T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells20–23. It has the advantage that it more closely resembles the clinical situation and allowed us to perform long-term monitoring of NPICC engraftment and rejection. We here demonstrate that HU-SRC-SCID mice are able to recognize transplanted wt NPICCs, mediate a significant anti-porcine immune response with human CD45+ leukocyte infiltrates, and are capable to infiltrate and destruct the wt xenograft. This provides evidence that HU-SRC-SCID mice are able to develop a functional active adaptive immune response.

Overexpression of LEA29Y in porcine beta cells had a profound inhibitory effect on cellular rejection over several months. Consistent with the metabolic data we observed suppression of peri- and intragraft infiltrations with human T cells and macrophages at early and late post-transplant stages. The reduced number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrates in LEA29Y-tg grafts indicates that transplanted LEA29Y-tg NPICCs can prevent the activation and recruitment of effector T cells to the transplantation site leading to long-term protection from rejection in the presence of a human immune system. The identification of an increased ratio of FoxP3+/CD4+ cells in LEA29Y-tg grafts suggests that regulatory T cells may be involved in the prevention of xenograft rejection. This interpretation is consistent with a recent publication reporting on FoxP3+ Treg cell-mediated tolerance induction against transplanted wild-type NPICCs by short-term treatment of BALB/c mice with CTLA-4 Fc and anti-CD154 antibodies24. Since transgenic grafts showed a tendency towards an increased proportion of intragraft FoxP3+ cells in the present study, the elucidation of the exact mechanisms involved in the protection of LEA29Y expressing xenografts requires further investigation.

FACS analysis carried out at the end of the study confirmed stable maintenance of human immune cells in all mice. Importantly, we observed neither increased susceptibility to infections in mice with LEA29Y-tg NPICCs nor significant differences in the proportion of human leukocytes and CD4+/CD8+ T cell populations between the transplantation groups. Additionally, plasma concentrations of LEA29Y were 30–100-fold lower as described in studies using belatacept for systemic immunosuppression after organ transplantation25. These findings suggest that beta cell-specific LEA29Y expression leads to high local but low systemic LEA29Y levels that may not have a strong systemic immunosuppressive effect9.

Naturally occurring antibodies directed to the αGal epitope are the major xenoantibodies in human sera and are induced after transplantation of porcine tissue in human beings and non-human primates14, 26. Because αGal Abs may be involved in xenorejection of NPICCs13, we measured total human IgG/IgM plasma concentrations and αGal Abs. In agreement with previous studies, HU-SRC-SCID mice produced low, but clearly detectable levels of human IgM and IgG antibodies, which correspond to about 5% (IgM) and 0.5% (IgG) of levels present in normal human plasma, respectively27, 28. IgG and IgM αGal Abs were not detected suggesting that αGal xenoantibodies are not involved in the rejection of wt NPICCs in the present study, but their relevance in a clinical setting needs to be addressed by using available knockout pigs (GTKO)29.

Although NSG mice allow high-level engraftment of human hematopoietic stem cells, the limitation of the present study is that these mice do not achieve a completely normal human immune system. The HU-SRC-SCID model shows decreased maturation of B cells and impaired innate immune cell development, e.g. reduced monocyte and NK cell activation23, 27, 30. This is explained by the lack of reactivity between murine cytokines and human immune cells. Consistently, we did not identify CD56+ NK cells infiltrating the grafts of transplanted mice. Therefore, it may be difficult to extrapolate our findings directly to the clinical situation and further preclinical studies in diabetic non-human primates are required.

In conclusion, we here demonstrated that beta cell-specific expression of LEA29Y is effective in long-lasting inhibition of xenoreactive, human immune cell-mediated rejection. Thus, overexpression of LEA29Y in porcine islets is very promising to develop a low-toxic immunosuppressive protocol for xenotransplantation.

Methods
Ethical statement
The study was approved by the university ethics committee and was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance and with the approval of the local animal welfare committee (district government of Upper Bavaria).

Animals
NOD-SCID IL2rγ−/− (NSG) mice, which lack mature T-, B-, and NK cells, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (USA) and housed under standard SPF conditions. Transgenic pigs (German landrace hybrid) expressing LEA29Y under control of the porcine insulin promoter were generated as described9. Donor piglets for transplantation experiments were produced by breeding.

Isolation of neonatal porcine ICCs
NPICCs were isolated from 2–5-day-old piglets using a protocol described by the group of Korbutt et al. with some modifications10, 11. Briefly, pancreas was removed and placed in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), cut into small pieces and digested with 1.4 mg/ml liberase (Roche, Germany) for 7–10 min at 37 °C. After filtration through a steel screen (500 μm), the tissue was washed five times with HBSS (Gibco, Germany). Then, the cell suspension was cultured in 150 mm diameter petri dishes for 5–6 days at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Germany) supplemented with 2% human serum albumin (Octapharm, Germany), 10 mmol/l nicotinamide, 20 nmol/l exenatide-4 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, Germany). After 5–6 days, islet clusters were harvested, washed and counted under a stereo microscope.

Transfer of human immune cells into NSG mice
Transfer of a human immune system into NSG mice was carried out as previously described20, 21. NSG mice (age 6–8 weeks) were treated with busulfan (i.p. injection of 30 mg Busulfex®/kg body weight, Otsuka Canada Pharmaceuticals, Canada) to precondition the bone marrow. After one day, human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were isolated from leukapheresis blood by ficoll density gradient centrifugation and positive selection using MACS hCD34 microbead Midi-Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) according to the manufacturer´s instruction. CD34+ cells with > 95% purity were transferred by tail vein injection (2.5 × 106 hCD34+ cells per mouse). Engraftment of the human immune system was confirmed by FACS analysis of blood cells (hCD45, mCD45, hCD3) at weeks 16–20 after cell transfer. NSG mice with an established human immune system (hCD45+ cells > 50% in peripheral blood) were used for transplantation experiments.

Transplantation of neonatal ICCs into hyperglycemic NSG mice
NSG mice exhibiting a robust engraftment of human immune cells (HU-SRC-SCID) or immunodeficient NSG mice (control mice for grafting) were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of 180 mg/kg streptozotocin (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). Diabetic animals (blood glucose levels > 350 mg/dl) were transplanted with either wt or LEA29Y-tg NPICCs (3000 IEQs/mouse) under the left kidney capsule as described previously9, 11. Neonatal NPICCs require a 6–12 weeks in vivo maturation period until physiological glucose-dependent insulin secretion has developed9–11. Blood glucose levels were monitored once per day (FreeStyle Lite, Abbott Diabetes Care, Germany). Severely diabetic mice received a daily subcutaneous insulin injection (0.25–1 IE glargine; Sanofi-Aventis, Germany) until blood glucose levels decreased to <300 mg/d. Normoglycemia was defined as persistent blood glucose levels <120 mg/dl. The observation period was set to a maximum of 125 days by study design (except of two mice, which were followed up for a period of 29 and 34 weeks post transplantation respectively). To exclude endogenous beta cell regeneration, the graft of three normoglycemic mice was removed at the end of the observation period by uninephrectomy and the reoccurrence of hyperglycemia was monitored. At predefined time-points (3 days and 3–4 weeks post-transplantation) one mouse in each group were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analyses. From each animal blood and specimen (spleen, bone marrow) for FACS analysis and immunohistochemistry (graft bearing kidney) were taken at the end of the study.

Characterization of graft function
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (i.p.GTT) was performed 10–14 days after development of normoglycemia (BG < 120 mg/dl) using 2 g glucose/kg body weight. Blood samples were obtained from the tail vein at 0 and 10 minutes after glucose load. Porcine serum insulin was determined by ELISA (Mercodia, Sweden) that displayed no cross-reactivity with mouse insulin. Mouse C-peptide was measured by ELISA (ALPCO, USA) which had no cross-reactivity with porcine C-peptide (assay sensitivity 7.6 pmol/l, range 60–3,000 pmol/l). Plasma concentrations of LEA29Y were measured in randomly fed mice at the end of the study by sandwich ELISA as described previously9.

Immunohistochemical analyses
The graft bearing kidney was subjected to immunohistochemistry to stain for insulin and infiltrating immune cells using specific antibodies for T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, FoxP3), macrophages (CD68), and NK cells (CD56). Serial paraffin sections were stained with guinea pig anti-insulin (1:500), rabbit anti-human CD3 (1:50), mouse anti-human CD4 (1:20), mouse anti-human CD56 (1:50) (DAKO, Germany), rabbit anti-human CD8 (1:80; Vector Laboratories, USA), rabbit anti-human CD45 (1:100; DAKO, Germany), mouse anti-human CD68 (1:50, DAKO, Germany), or rabbit anti-human FoxP3 (1:50, Spring Bioscience, USA). As secondary antibodies HRP-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Germany), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (Southern Biotech, USA) were used. Fuchsin + Substrate (DAKO, Germany) or DAB (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostics, Denmark) were used as chromogens. To visualize CD45, CD3, CD4, and CD68 the M.O.M. Kit from Vector Laboratories was used, whereas the UltraVision™ Quanto Detection System HRP DAB (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) was applied as for staining against CD8, the ImmPRESS™ Excel Amplified HRP Polymer Staining Kit (Vector) was used for detection of FoxP3, and CD56 staining was conducted with the Mouse on Mouse (M.O.M.™) ImmPRESS™ HRP (Peroxidase) Polymer Kit (Vector). Immune cell infiltration was scored independently by two researchers using insulin and anti-hCD45 co-stained sections as previously described31. Beta cell insulin score: 0: no insulin staining, 1: presence of scattered insulin-positive cells, 2: presence of insulin-positive cell aggregates, 3: presence of preserved insulin-positive clusters; Graft immune cell infiltrate: 0: no cell infiltrate, 1: presence of cell infiltrate in the periphery of the NPICC grafts, 2: mononuclear infiltration in the periphery and focal intra-islet infiltration, 3: extensive peri- and intra-islet infiltration. Photographs of co-stained sections against insulin and hCD3, hCD4, hCD8, hCD68, hFoxP3, or hCD56 were taken using a Leica DM2000 LED microscope coupled to a Leica CMC2900 camera (Leica Microsystems, Germany) (100x magnification). Quantitative analysis of the number of infiltrating immune cells per graft area was carried out with the Zen imaging software (Carl Zeiss, Germany). A total number of at least 5 power fields corresponding to a mean graft area of 1.5 ± 0.1 mm2 per animal were investigated. The frequencies of infiltrating T cells and macrophages are presented as number of infiltrating cells per mm2 graft tissue. The counts of hFoxP3+ regulatory T cells were normalized to CD4+ T cells and expressed in percent of CD4 + cells (number of FoxP3+ cells per mm2 graft tissue /number of CD4+ cells/mm2 graft tissue × 100).

Flow cytometry
The proportion of human immune cells in the peripheral blood (weeks 16–20 after hCD34+ transfer and at the end of the study) was determined by FACS analysis. Heparinized blood (100 µl) was taken from the tail vein. After lysis of erythrocytes cells were washed in PBS with 10% FCS (FACS buffer), stained with fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to hCD45-APC, hCD3-PE, hCD4-APC (ebioscience, Germany), hCD8-PE (Exbio Praha, Czech Republic), mCD45-FITC (BioLegend, CA, USA), and analyzed by FACS analysis using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Germany). At the end of the study cell suspensions were prepared from the spleen and bone marrow as described previously32, 33. After lysis of erythrocytes 3 × 105 cells from bone marrow or spleen were suspended in 100 µl FACS buffer and stained for 30 min with mAb to determine the frequency of murine (mCD45-FITC) and human (hCD45-APC) cells carrying leukocyte common antigen (expressed on all hematopoietic cells) and T cells (human CD3-PE, human CD4, human CD8). After two washing steps in FACS buffer cells were analyzed on Accuri C6. Matched isotype antibodies served as controls.

Measurement of antibodies
Total human immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) plasma levels were measured using ELISA kits (eBioscience, Germany). Xenoantibodies to the disaccharide galactosyl-alpha(1,3)-galactose (Galα1-3 Gal) epitope were measured in the sera of HU-SRC-SCID mice 7–10 days before transplantation and at the end of the observation period by ELISA. ELISA plates (Nunc/Thermo Fisher, Germany) were coated with 1 µg per well Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNac-HSA (3 atom pacer) (Dextra Laboratories, UK) overnight in 100 µl 100 mM carbonate buffer pH 9.4 at 4 °C. Then plates were blocked with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3 supplemented with 0.5% human albumin (HSA) and 0.02% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature (RT), washed two times with washing buffer (PBS + 0.1% HSA + 0.02% Tween 20) and incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of the serum probes (humanized NSG mice: 1:25- 1:200; human sera: 1:250-1:5000). After 2 h plates were washed five times with washing buffer and incubated with goat anti-human IgG-HRP (1:6000) or goat anti-human IgM-HRP (1:2000) (DAKO, Germany) for 30 min at RT. Plates were washed five-times with washing buffer followed by addition of 100 µl TMB substrate solution (R&D Systems, MN, USA). After 10 min the reaction was stopped by 100 µl 2 N H2SO4. Absorbance was measured on an ELISA reader at 450 nm (Tecan, Switzerland). In each plate a standard curve (serum pool of human sera: 1:500-1:32000 for IgG α-gal antibodies and 1:100-1:8000 for IgM α-gal antibodies) and negative control sera (native NSG mice) were included. Values were expressed as arbitrary units (AU) calculated from the standard curve.

A CASE OF HIRUDINIASIS OF THE
MALE URETHRA.
X By Capt. P. N. MITRA, m.b., d.t.m. (Cal.),
Civil Assistant Surgeon, Assam.
A patient, M. M., aged 8 years, came to
hospital at 4 p.m. in October 1925 with the
following history.?He was fishing with a rod
at about 12 noon in a marsh (bhil), standing knee-
deep in water without any clothes on, when he
suddenly noticed a leech entering his external
meatus urinarius. He tried to pull it out but the
leech slipped inside and he had been unable to
pass any urine and blood dripped from his urethra.
On examination I found blood dripping from
the external meatus and his clothing over the
corresponding area was soaked with blood. A
soft rubber catheter was passed and met with no
obstruction; bright red blood diluted with urine
was drawn out of the bladder. The bladder was
washed out and the washings returned blood-
tinged. Some strong salt solution and adrenalin
was left in the bladder, the catheter withdrawn
and the patient put to bed. No voluntary micturi-
tion was possible the next morning. Bloody
urine was again withdrawn through the catheter,
strong saline and adrenalin being repeated as
before. As voluntary micturition was not pos-
sible catheterization was repeated in the afternoon
and again next morning. During the last a cer-
tain amount of dark-brown granular blood was
withdrawn. Catheterization was repeated in the
afternoon with the same result, and during the
night the leech was passed out with violent
colicky pains. It measured 4 in. by i in.; the
mouth and anus were open and dark granular
blood could be pressed out of its abdomen.
The points to be noted are:?
(1) The rarity of the accident.
(2) The leech bit at one or more points in
the anterior urethra and then passed into the
bladder where it fed itself.
(3) It was killed by salt solution.
(4) After death of the leech the sphincters
relaxed, permitting regurgitation of some of its
abdominal contents.
(5) It then became flaccid and engorgement
occurred leading to its spontaneous extrusion.
(6) The boy was circumcised.

Recently it has been shown that radiation induces migration of glioma cells and facilitates a further spread of tumor cells locally and systemically. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether radiotherapy induces migration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A further aim was to investigate the effects of blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream pathways (Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt) on tumor cell migration in vitro.

Methods
Migration of tumor cells was assessed via a wound healing assay and proliferation by a MTT colorimeritric assay using 3 HNSCC cell lines (BHY, CAL-27, HN). The cells were treated with increasing doses of irradiation (2 Gy, 5 Gy, 8 Gy) in the presence or absence of EGF, EGFR-antagonist (AG1478) or inhibitors of the downstream pathways PI3K (LY294002), mTOR (rapamycin) and MEK1 (PD98059). Biochemical activation of EGFR and the downstream markers Akt and ERK were examined by Western blot analysis.

Results
In absence of stimulation or inhibition, increasing doses of irradiation induced a dose-dependent enhancement of migrating cells (p < 0.05 for the 3 HNSCC cell lines) and a decrease of cell proliferation (p < 0.05 for the 3 HNSCC cell lines). The inhibition of EGFR or the downstream pathways reduced cell migration significantly (almost all p < 0.05 for the 3 HNSCC cell lines). Stimulation of HNSCC cells with EGF caused a significant increase in migration (p < 0.05 for the 3 HNSCC cell lines). After irradiation alone a pronounced activation of EGFR was observed by Western blot analysis.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that the EGFR is involved in radiation induced migration of HNSCC cells. Therefore EGFR or the downstream pathways might be a target for the treatment of HNSCC to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.
==== Body
Background
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide [1]. In case of a primary radiotherapy patients get no surgery. Therefore radiation doses need to be higher than in those cases where the patient gets surgery and a postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy.

Anti-neoplastic properties of ionizing radiation are primarily related to DNA damage. This treatment is an established measure for HNSCC therapy [2,3]. Despite technological advances and increased radiation intensity only approximately half of the patients get cured [4]. The outcome of patients presenting more advanced stages is even poorer, with 5-year actuarial survival rates of about 30% [5]. These findings underscore the need to develop novel strategies in the management of patient with advanced HNSCC.

In the last decade significant progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for human cancer development and progression. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the structurally related erbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors, has been implicated in cancer development and progression in a large number of tumors including HNSCC [6]. EGFR over-expression occurs early in the pathogenesis of HNSCC [7] and is associated with reduced relapse-free survival or poor overall survival time [8]. Also a new study shows, that EGFR protein levels strongly predict for patient outcome in HNSCC [9]. At a clinical level, inhibition of EGFR with monoclonal antibody showed therapeutic effects with better survival of patients when added to standard radiotherapy [10]. In advanced or metastatic tumors cetuximab plus chemotherapy had significant effects compared with chemotherapy alone on outcome of overall survival and progression-free survival [11].

Interestingly, in a glioma cell model it has been shown that sublethal irradiation promotes migration and invasion of tumor cells [12].

It has been shown on a molecular level that radiation induces an overexpression of EGFRs in many HNSCC [7,13,14]. Cassell et al. mentioned that inhibition of EGFR with a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab, Erbitux™), enhanced the development of more effective HNSCC treatments. But there is a need of a prospective identification of patients who would benefit from such a therapy [15]. Besides, a phase III randomised trial has shown that the combination of radiotherapy with the EGFR antibody cetuximab significantly improves overall survival at 5 years [16].

Molecular research has identified a host of new biological parameters with potential predictive utility. Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell-cycle control genes, apoptosis genes and angiogenesis genes have been extensively studied and correlated with radiation response [17,18].

Akt (protein kinase b) as a possible response modulator has recently fostered molecular strategies which employ blockade of the receptor to down-regulate tumor growth [19]. Besides, inhibition of Rhokinase or PI3 kinase decreases tumor growth and cisplatin resistance in HNSCC [20]. Also, expression levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR are higher in HNSCC than in non-cancer patients [21].

The PI3K dependent pathway and the ERK pathway are important pathways for tumor biology [22]. Raf/MEK/ERK connect mitogen signals [23], whereas the PI3K dependent activation of the Akt seems to be important for anti-apoptosis and migration [24,25] (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Components of the EGFR pathways and their specific inhibitors. EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor), PIP2, PIP3 (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), MAPK/ERK (mitogen activited proteinkinase), mTOR/FRAP (Mammalian target of rapamycin), PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-3'-Kinase), PKB/Akt (Proteinkinase B), PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten).

The purpose of our study was twofold: (1) to investigate radiation induced migration of the well established HNSSC cell lines (BHY, CAL-27 and HN) and (2) to investigate the possibility of inhibiting migration by blocking the EGF receptor pathways.

Methods
Cell culture and irradiation
The cell lines HN, BHY [26] and CAL-27 [27] were used (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) or Roswell park memorial institute medium (RPMI 1640) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 grown to a 70-90% confluence.

Irradiation was performed at the Department of Radiotherapy (Technical University of Munich). Cells were X-irradiated with single doses of 2, 5 or 8 Gy with a Philips RT 100 (Philips, Amsterdam) operated at 300 kV with 1.4 mm copper half-value layer at a dose rate of approximately 1 Gy/min. The dose inhomogeneity was ± 2%. The sham-treated group (0 Gy, control) was subjected to the same protocol as exposed cells.

Wound healing assay
Investigation of cell migration capability after irradiation treatment was performed by a modified wound healing assay, as described before [28]: Briefly, treated and untreated cells were grown to confluent monolayers. Immediately before irradiation the inhibitors rapamycin (100 nM) (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), LY294002 (50 μM) (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), PD98059 (50 μM) (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), tyrphostin AG1478 (10 μM) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/ml) (Upstate, Billerica, USA) were separately added to the medium. After that, the monolayers were wounded by scratching the surface as uniformly as possible with a 200 μl pipette tip (Sarstedt AG & Co., Nümbrecht, Germany). After irradiation cells were cultivated for another 12 hrs. This initial wounding (0 hr) and the movement of the cells in the scratched area were photographically monitored under an inverted light microscope (field of view by a 40 fold magnification - Axiovert 25, Carl Zeiss AG, Göttingen, Germany, equipped with an Olympus SC 35 Camera, Volketswil, Switzerland). Migrating cells were counted 12 hours after irradiation (Figure 2). These time points were chosen because in former experiments all cells were grown to confluence after 36 hours (data not shown).

(A) Migrating cells of the wound healing assay -/+ irradiation were presented as pictures (40 fold magnification, Axiovert 25, Carl Zeiss AG, Göttingen) 12 hours after irradiation. (B) The pictures were fused and the highlighted cells were counted.

Modified Boyden chamber
To confirm the results of the scratch test we analyzed the migration by a modified Boyden chamber. Cells were given to a transwell permeable polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 0.8 μm (Corning Incorporated, New York, USA). Inhibitors were added in the medium above and under the membrane then irradiation were done. 12 hrs later cells above the membrane were removed by a cotton drill, and fixed with DAPI. Thereafter cells were counted under a microscope. These experiments were performed to show consistent and comparable results of radiation induced migration.

Proliferation assessment
The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) was used to assess cell proliferation, as previously described [29]. Briefly, cells were plated on 96-well plates at a concentration of 1000 cells/well. The above-mentioned inhibitors were added 12 hours prior to irradiation. After incubation, and 12, 24 and 72 hours after irradiation, 10 μl of MTT solution was added to each well for four hours (37°C). Subsequently, 100 μl of dimethylsulfoxide was added to each well, yielding purple solution. The optical density was measured at 590 nm using an ELISA reader (ASYS Hitech, Eugendorf, Germany) and ratios in relation to controls were made. All experiments were performed eight times (n = 8).

Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblot analysis was performed to determine EGFR expression including its downstream proteins ERK and Akt. 12 hours after irradiation, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (Cell Lysis Buffer, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) at 4°C. Lysates were centrifuged (10000 rpm) for 15 minutes at 4°C to remove insoluble components. Protein content was quantified by the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio Rad, Hercules, USA). Equal amounts of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE 10% or 12.5% gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0,1% Tween 20 (TBST) and afterwards incubated with primary antibody in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST, followed by secondary antibody linked to rabbitradish peroxidase diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST. ECL Detection System for Western blot Analysis (Amersham, Freiburg, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Imager SRX-101° (Konica Minolta, Langenhagen, Germany) was used to detect bands of appropriate sizes. The following antibodies were used: phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068), phospho-Akt (Ser473), PKB/Akt, phospho-p44/42 ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), p44/42 ERK, phospho-Raf (Ser259), phospho-MEK1/2, and MEK1/2. All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, (Boston, USA) and used at a dilution of 1:1000.

Data and statistical analysis
For the investigation of cell migration, a two-factorial design was considered with the factors "treatment" (control, EGF, LY294002, PD98059, rapamycin, AG1478) and radiation dose (ranging from 0 Gy to 8 Gy). The whole analysis was repeated n = 9 times. Cell proliferation was investigated for all six treatments, for doses 0 Gy and 8 Gy only. For each dose and each group, the sample size was n = 8. In the whole study, the cells were randomly assigned to the treatment groups and radiation doses.

Radiation induced migration was assessed in a linear regression model were migration was set as dependent variable and the radiation dose as the metric predictor. The potential dose dependent inhibition or enhancement of migration through stimulation was investigated based on a generalized least squares model fitted with the R function 'gls' with the migration as dependent variable. The predictors were: the radiation dose (metric predictor, coefficient βrad), the treatment (categorical predictor with coefficients βEGF, βAG, etc and controls as reference category), and their interactions (coefficients βrad.EGF, βrad.AG, etc). A uniform correlation structure was assumed within each of the n = 9 experiments, corresponding to a linear mixed model with a random forest for each experiment. Residual analysis showed that this model can reasonably be applied to the data at hand. Additionally, linear hypotheses tests were performed in the above GLS model to test the effect of the radiation dose in the presence of treatment (tested hypotheses: βrad+βrad.EGF = 0, βrad+βrad.AG = 0, etc). Confidence intervals for the estimated coefficients were calculated, and all hypotheses were tested based on the Wald test. Separate analyses were conducted for the three cell lines BHY, CAL-27 and HN for the time point 12 hours. The t-test was used to compare proliferation in two conditions. Confidence intervals for the difference of means were calculated. All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical software http://www.r-project.org, version 2.6.1.

Results
Blocking of EGFR decreased radiation induced migration
The cultured cell lines BHY, CAL-27 and HN were irradiated with 2, 5 and 8 Gy and monitored during 12 hours. The means and standard errors of nine tests per time point and dose were calculated for each cell line. Radiation induced a significant dose dependent migration of tumor cells after irradiation compared to the control group (BHY: βrad = 16, CI:[6;26], p = 0.003, CAL-27: βrad = 20, CI:[10;30], p < 0.001, HN: βrad = 37, CI:[22;51], p < 0.001) (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Radiation induced migration. The number of migrating cells after irradiation with 0, 2, 5, and 8 Gy were determined by the wound healing assay for the HNSCC cell lines BHY, CAL-27 and HN. Cells were grown to confluent monolayers, wounded by scratching the surface as uniformly as possible with a pipette tip and afterwards irradiated. The number of migrated tumor cells in the wound was determined. The means and standard errors of 9 tests per time point and dose were calculated after 12 hrs. An increased time dependent migration of tumor cells after irradiation was observed after treatment compared to the control group of not irradiated cells (p < 0.009).

The findings of the wound healing assay were consistent with the results of the modified Boyden chamber where a radiation induced migration was also observed.

The stimulation of not irradiated (0 Gy) cells with EGF lead to a significant increase of migration in all cell lines (tested hypothesis βEGF = 0, BHY: βEGF = 137 CI:[66;209], p < 0.001, CAL-27: βEGF = 79, CI:[1;156], p = 0.048, HN: βEGF = 211, CI:[113;308], p < 0.001). In contrast, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 significantly decreased migration (Figure 4).

Figure 4 AG1478 inhibits radiation induced migration. Migration ability of the 3 different HNSCC cell lines after stimulation with EGF and blocking of the EGFR with AG1478 was determined by the wound healing assay. The means of 9 tests per dosage were calculated after 12 hrs. The increase of migration with increasing radiation dosis was significantly less pronounced after stimulation with EGF and after blocking of EGFR with AG1478 than in control cells.

The radiation-induced increase of migration was significantly less pronounced after stimulation with EGF (tested hypothesis βrad.EGF = 0, BHY: βrad.EGF = -26, CI:[-41;-11], p < 0.001, CAL-27: βrad.EGF = -26, CI:[-42,-10], p = 0.002, HN: βrad.EGF = -21, CI:[-41,-1;], p = 0.042) as well as after inhibition with AG1478 (tested hypothesis βrad.AG = 0, BHY: βrad.AG = -17, CI:[-32;-2], p = 0.028, CAL-27: βrad.AG = -19, CI:[-35;-3], p = 0.021, HN: βrad.AG = -31, CI:[-52,-11], p = 0.003) than in control cells (Figure 3). More precisely, migration did not increase significantly with radiation dose in the cells stimulated with EGF or inhibited with AG1478 (tested hypotheses: βrad+βrad.EGF = 0, βrad+βrad.AG = 0, p > 0.05), in contrast to what happens in control cells.

Radiation-induced migration can be blocked by inhibition of EGFR downstream pathways
Additionally to the above mentioned inhibition of the EGF receptor, we blocked the downstream pathways of EGFR: PI3K by LY294002 (30 minutes before radiation), mTOR by rapamycin (1 hour before radiation) and MEK1 by PD98059 (30 minutes before radiation). A significant negative interaction between irradiation and the inhibitors was seen in the HN cell line after 12 hours. These findings indicate that the radiation-induced migration of tumor cells was decreased significantly by downstream inhibitors of the EGFR (Table 1). Migration was most effectively decreased by blocking of PI3K (LY294002) (Figure 5, Table 1).

Figure 5 Migration ability of the HNSCC cell lines after blocking of the downstream pathways of the EGFR: PI3K by LY294002 (LY), mTOR by rapamycin (RA) and MEK1 by PD98059 (PD) after irradiation with 0, 2, 5 and 8 Gy after 12 hours. Measurements were made in 9 experiments. The effect of radiation on migration was significantly reduced by inhibitors of the downstream pathways of EGFR. (A cell line BHY, B cell line CAL-27, C cell line HN)

The p-values are shown for the effect of blocking in controls (tested hypotheses: βLY = 0, βPD = 0, βRA = 0) and for the interaction (+) with radiation (tested hypotheses: βrad.LY = 0, βrad.PD = 0, βrad.RA = 0, etc). All interaction coefficients were negative, indicating that the effect of radiation on migration was weaker after inhibition. (LY294002 (LY), PD98059 (PD), rapamycin (RA))

After inhibition migration did not significantly increase with radiation dose (tested hypotheses: βrad+βrad.LY = 0, βrad+βrad.Rapa = 0, βrad+βrad.PD = 0, p > 0.05) in all 3 cell lines, in contrast to what happens in controls. Thus, inhibition seems to attenuate the influence of radiation on migration.

Proliferation subsided by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway
The strongest migration ability was observed at the dose of 8 Gy. Therefore we focused on studying the effects elicited at this radiation dose. We found a significant decrease of proliferation after radiation with 8 Gy after 72 hours (BHY: CI:[-0.19,-0.12], p < 0.001; CAL-27: CI:[-0.13,-0.05], p < 0.001; HN: CI:[-0.07,-0.01], p = 0.014). Stimulation with EGF showed no significant effect on proliferation (BHY: CI:[-0.11,0.06], p = 0.5; CAL-27: CI:[-0.09,-0.01], p = 0.02; HN: CI:[0.02,0.09], p = 0.005) without radiation, and no significant effect by simultaneously radiation with 8 Gy (BHY: CI:[-0.06,0.10], p = 0.57; CAL-27: CI:[-0.05,0.01], p = 0.19; HN: CI:[-0.05,0.005], p = 0.10). After EGF receptor blockade with AG1478 a significant decrease in proliferation was observed, compared to the control group (BHY: CI:[-0.27,-0.15],, CAL-27: CI:[-0.20,-0.14],, HN: CI:[-0.13,-0.07], p < 0.001).

Inhibition of MEK1 with PD98059 or inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin reduced significantly proliferation (BHY: CI:[-0.25,-0.12], CAL-27: CI:[-0.17,-0.10], HN: CI:[-0.15,-0.07], p < 0.001). Blocking of PI3K with LY294002 also reduced proliferation (BHY: CI:[-0.36,-0.31], CAL-27: CI:[-0.26,-0.20], HN: CI:[-0.24,-0.18], p < 0.001) (Figure 6).

Figure 6 A+B+C. Subsided proliferation after inhibition. Proliferation was assessed by the MTT test 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 72 hrs after irradiation with 8 Gy or without irradiation (0 Gy). Proliferation subsided by radiation of the cell line CAL-27 and also by inhibition of the EGFR by AG1478 (AG) and after blocking of the downstream pathways of the EGFR: PI3K by LY294002 (LY), mTOR by rapamycin (Rapa) and MEK1 by PD98059 (PD), control.

EGFR activation after irradiation was detected by Western blot analysis
Protein was isolated at 0 hours and 24 hours after radiation with 8 Gy. In all 3 cell lines we found a constitutive activation of Akt and ERK. The stimulation with EGF preceded an up-regulation of EGFR phosphorylation and a phosphorylation of the downstream pathways. Blockade of the EGFR by AG1478 provoked a down regulation of the receptor, the PI3K/Akt and the Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. This effect continued during 24 hours. After radiation an up regulation of the EGFR phosphorylation was observed. The western blot results are presented in Figure 7.

Figure 7 pEGFR activation by irradiation. The Western blot results were presented in figure form. Protein isolation was done 12 hrs after irradiation with 8 Gy. EGFR was stimulated by EGF and inhibited by AG1478 (AG) and the downstream pathways of EGFR: PI3K by LY294002 (LY), mTOR by rapamycin (Rapa) and MEK1 by PD98059 (PD), control. We find an up-regulation of phospho-EGFR after radiation.

Discussion
Survival rates of HNSCC patients have not improved during the last decades [1]. HNSCC cells distinguish through infiltrative growth in the surrounded area. This is the reason for locally advanced disease in over 40% of patients [30]. Often tumor location does not allow an in sano resection without severe impairment in functions like swallowing, speech or respiration. Therefore primary radiation therapy is an established therapy of inoperable HNSCC, but the prognosis is poor with five-year-cure rates rarely exceeding 50% [4,31]. Additionally, radiation combined with chemotherapy has been shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone. There are benefits in terms of survival and organ preservation [5]. Also new strategies like the combined-treatment with cisplatin and hyperfractionated radiation therapy maintained improved rates of locoregional control, distant metastasis-free survival, and cancer-specific survival [32]. But unfortunately, no criteria for response to the radiation therapy have been found.

In this study we could demonstrate for the first time a radiation induced migration of HNSCC cells like it is known for glioma cells [12,33]. Proliferating cells could make a misleading result in the wound healing assay, because they appear to imitate migration. However, this effect is not caused by proliferating cells, because it was shown in the MTT test that cell proliferation decreases, when cells are irradiated.

Our results showed that migration is increased by stimulation of the cells with EGF and by radiation treatment. The mechanism might be a radiation induced an autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor with an activation of the downstream pathways, previously observed [14,34]. Blockade of the EGFR by AG1478 that leads to a significant inhibition of migration might support this observation.

The EGFR plays an important role in tumor biology of HNSCC. In a systematic review, the EGFR signaling is associated with poor prognosis and response to therapy in cervical cancer patients primarily treated with chemoradiation [35]. Bonner et al. showed that the combination of radiotherapy and cetuximab improved the overall survival significantly [16]. Also Frampton found in the setting of locally advanced, unresectable disease, cetuximab plus radiation offers an alternative approach to the current standard of care, namely platinum-based chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and in recurrent and metastatic HNSCC, cetuximab plus platinum-based chemotherapy provides a first-line treatment of choice [36]. The reason for this might be a reduction in cell migration after blocking the EGFR in combination with radiation, as we observed. Recent studies give an account of Akt induced migration [37,38]. Therefore we focused on the EGFR downstream pathways Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt and investigated whether a correlation with the radiation-induced migration existed. A relation between the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the migration was assumed, because inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 and blockade of mTOR by rapamycin involved a significant decrease of migrating cells. The same effect was seen after inhibition of MEK1 by PD98059. This was confirmed by our western blot results: after radiation we observed an up-regulation of phospho-EGFR, like described in a previous study [14].

The observed constitutive activation of Akt in our HNSCC cell lines was recently confirmed by Bussink et al. [39]. Additionally, clinical trials have shown a strong and independent association between activated Akt expression and treatment outcome [39]. Immediately after inhibition of the PI3K, we saw a down regulation of phospho-Akt, phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK on protein level, whereas phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK were up regulated through the lapse of the Akt dependent phosphorylation of Raf1 on Ser259 after 24 hours as shown by Zimmermann et al. [40].

Actually, the therapy of patients with HNSCC in the advanced stage III and IV implies primary radiotherapy in combination with a chemotherapy [5] and altered fractionation radiotherapy has a benefit for patient survival [31]. Our data indicate that a change in the therapeutic strategies of patients with HNSCC might be useful. Inhibition of the EGFR and/or downstream pathways in combination with the radiotherapy might be an option to the conventional radiation and chemotherapy of patients with HNSCC. In an animal model of nude mice it was shown, that the inhibition of the PI3K by LY294002 in combination with radiation induced a significantly better outcome [41]. Also in human studies involving HNSCC patients treated with a combination of radiation and EGFR antagonization an overall survival benefit was observed in 10%-15% of treated patients [42].

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that the EGFR and the downstream signals like PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK are involved in radiation induced migration of HNSCC cells and might be a future target for the therapy of HNSCC in combination with radiotherapy.

Several reports have highlighted the association of low serum testosterone levels with high-grade, high-stage PCa. However, the impact of serum testosterone as a predictor of progression in men with low-risk PCa has been little assessed.

In this study, we evaluated the association of circulating testosterone concentrations with a staging/grading reclassification in a cohort of low-risk PCa patients meeting the inclusion criteria for the AS protocol but opting for radical prostatectomy.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) was performed in 338 patients, eligible for AS according to the following criteria: clinical stage T2a or less, PSA<10ng/ml, two or fewer cancer cores, Gleason score (GS)=6 and PSA density<0.2 ng/mL/cc. Reclassification was defined as upstaging (stage>pT2) and upgrading (GS=7; primary Gleason pattern 4) disease. Unfavorable disease was defined as the occurrence of pathological stage>pT2 and predominant Gleason score 4. Total testosterone was measured before surgery.

Low serum testosterone levels (<300 ng/dL) were significantly associated with upgrading, upstaging, unfavorable disease and positive surgical margins. The addition of testosterone to a base model, including age, PSA, PSA density, clinical stage and positive cancer involvement in cores, showed a significant independent influence of this variable on upstaging, upgrading and unfavorable disease.

In conclusion, our results support the idea that total testosterone should be a selection criterion for inclusion of low-risk PCa patients in AS programs and suggest that testosterone level less than 300 ng/dL should be considered a discouraging factor when a close AS program is considered as treatment option

INTRODUCTION
Active surveillance (AS) has recently emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa)-related mortality, whereby curative intervention can be delayed until the time that disease is re-classified or there is evidence of disease progression [1]. At present, urologists still suffer from a limited preoperative ability to reliably predict the tumor aggressiveness. Clinical stage, tumor grade (biopsy Gleason score) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are the established preoperative prognostic markers. However, despite these variables it is still difficult to determine which patients are candidates for AS. Literature data indicate a progression rate of about 30% in men on AS and a PCa-specific survival of < 97% at 5 years [2]. Thus, there is an urgent need of additional markers allowing us to discriminate between indolent or aggressive diseases.

Accumulating data indicate an important association between low testosterone concentrations and worrisome aspects of PCa. Multiple studies have reported the association of lower serum testosterone concentrations with high-grade PCa and a higher stage at presentation [3–6]. Furthermore, there is growing evidence supporting the theory that a drop in serum testosterone levels may modulate PCa risk and aggressiveness, since different metabolic disorders, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS), which are associated with low serum testosterone levels, have also been associated with an unfavorable PCa outcome [7, 8].

On this basis, total testosterone should be measured in patients with a localized PCa, in particularly when AS or nerve-sparing surgery is considered. In this study, we explored the impact of serum testosterone on upgrading, upstaging, unfavorable disease, positive surgical margins and predominant Gleason score 4 in a cohort of patients with very low-risk PCa who met the inclusion criteria for Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol, but elected to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP).

RESULTS
A total of 338 patients with PCa were enrolled in this study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the overall study population are summarized in Table 1.

Total testosterone levels showed a significant association with all the main outcomes of interest (Table 2). In particular, when treated as a continuous variable, lower total testosterone levels (median [IQR]) were associated with reclassification in terms of upstaging (299.5 [250 ; 390] vs. 488.5 [401 ; 600]; p < 0.001), upgrading (400.5 [292.25 ; 534] vs. 497.5 [401 ; 600]; p < 0.001), unfavorable disease (290 [250 ; 300] vs. 456 [390 ; 567]; p < 0.001) and predominant Gleason score 4 (300 [254 ; 502] vs. 477 [398 ; 597]; p < 0.001) . These associations were confirmed when subjects were analysed according to the presence or absence of a hypogonadism condition (total testosterone < 300 ng/dL). In addition, we found a significantly higher rate of hypogonadism in PCa patients with positive surgical margins (27.8% vs. 14.2%; p = 0.035). Of note, cancer involvement in positive cores (CIPC) was also significantly associated with all the outcomes (Table 2a and 2b). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis supported the prognostic role of total testosterone in the reclassification of men on AS (Figures 1-4). The corresponding area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.66 (95% C.I. 0.60 to 0.72) for upgrading, to 0.81 (95% C.I. 0.75 to 0.88) for upstaging. Sensitivities and specificities of total testosterone for each of the outcomes and according to both the “best combination” cut-off point and the cut-off point denoting a condition of hypogonadism are reported in Table 3a and 3b. To assess the role of total testosterone as an independent predictor of reclassification, a set of multivariable logistic regression models including age, PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE) status and cancer involvement in positive cores (CIPC) was constructed (Table 4). Total testosterone included in these base models was a significant independent predictor, both as a continuous and dichotomous variable, of upstaging, upgrading and unfavorable disease. However, a significant gain in predictive accuracy was only detected for the outcome of upstaging (15.2% when considering total testosterone as a continuous variable and 12.4% when treating total testosterone as a dichotomous variable) and predominant Gleason score 4 (9.4% or 8.3%, respectively). No advantages over the base model were observed for the outcome of upgrading, unfavourable disease and for the prediction of positive surgical margins.

DISCUSSION
The principal aim of an AS program is to reduce over-treatment in patients with clinically confined, very-low-risk PCa, without compromising curative treatment [9]. The identification of these low risk PCa is still a critical issue today, and many markers have been identified for selecting candidates for non-aggressive therapies [10–16]. Although the selection criteria for AS include stringent clinicopathological parameters, it is well established that about a third of men on AS will undergo progression requiring active treatment [1, 17]. Therefore, there is a strong interest in finding risk factors for reclassification and progression, particularly in men with a long life expectancy [18]. Conflicting results have been reported on the risk/benefit ratio of AS as upfront treatment strategy allowing radical treatment to be delayed or avoided [19–22]. Therefore, an important focus for AS protocols is to improve the selection of patients at the time of inclusion in order to minimize the reclassification of risk during follow-up. In this context, several tools have been proposed to overcome these limitations of current AS protocols. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [23], urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) and serum markers [24], histopathological [25–27] and genetic factors [28–30] have been analyzed.

Little is yet known about the clinical utility of serum testosterone levels as a predictor of disease reclassification in men on AS. Recently, in a relatively small population San Francisco et al [31] showed that free, but not total testosterone levels nor the free testosterone/total testosterone ratio or the testosterone/PSA ratio, were significantly lower in men with PCa and disease reclassification during AS. A number of previous reports identified a significant relationship between a high Gleason score and low testosterone levels [32–35]. Furthermore, growing evidence supports the idea that a decreased serum testosterone concentration, related to different metabolic disorders including obesity and metabolic syndrome, may modulate PCa aggressiveness [36].

We assessed the use of serum total testosterone as a predictor of disease reclassification in a cohort of men eligible for AS according to PRIAS criteria. Our results showed that men who underwent reclassification had significantly lower serum total testosterone levels compared to those who were not reclassified (p < 0.001). By ROC curve analysis, we identified a testosterone threshold of 344 ng/dL, 431 ng/dL, 302 ng/dL and 315 for upstaging, upgrading, unfavorable disease and predominant Gleason score 4 respectively. Men with testosterone levels lower than these values had a higher risk of disease reclassification. When the threshold value for hypogonadism ( < 300ng/dL) was used as cut-off [6, 37], we found significantly more patients with upstaging, upgrading, unfavorable disease, positive surgical margins and predominant Gleason score 4 compared to eugonadal patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that serum total testosterone, used either as a continuous or a dichotomous variable, was an independent predictor of upgrading, upstaging, unfavorable disease and predominant Gleason score 4.

Pichon et al [33] had shown in a larger study population that a low serum testosterone level was an independent predictor of a predominant Gleason pattern 4 at radical prostatectomy and of upgrading from low- to high-grade PCa between needle biopsies and prostatectomy specimens. Accordingly, the San Francisco et al study [31] showed that men on AS with low serum free testosterone levels had more than four times the risk of disease reclassification, suggesting the need for further studies to assess testosterone as a tool to better select patients for AS.

Collectively, our results suggest the importance of taking into account hypogonadism and metabolic disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, as selection criteria for patients inclusion in AS programs. Consistently, the majority of large observational series have shown that obesity is a risk factor for adverse pathologic features, a more advanced stage, higher risk for biochemical recurrence after RP, and risk of death from PCa [7, 38, 39].

Our findings support the use of total testosterone as a predictor of disease reclassification for men with PCa undergoing AS. Moreover, our models including testosterone showed a significant gain in predictive accuracy of upstaging and unfavorable disease.

These data are consistent with the idea that patients with low serum testosterone levels are more likely to have aggressive PCa. AS protocols in these patients should ensure close monitoring of PSA levels and imaging examinations, in order to identify tumor progression as early as possible.

The strength of this study is the large population (338 patients on AS), allowing a robust statistical analysis. Furthermore, as recommended by the Endocrine Society guidelines, all blood samples for testosterone were analyzed using the same platform, and were collected between 07:00 AM to 10:00 AM hours, in order to avoid circadian variations and inter-assay variability. Total testosterone was measured with one of the best electrochemiluminescent immunoassays and the histological analysis of prostate biopsies and prostatectomy specimens was done by three senior uropathologists avoiding variability in Gleason scores interpretation. Moreover, exclusion criteria were strictly defined to rule out patients that had received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy or affected by other comorbidities that can affect the testosterone levels.

However, some limitations have to be taken into account. Firstly, our study was carried out retrospectively, and several useful measures that affect testosterone values, such as Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone and oestradiol, were not determined. In addition, like previous reports on the association between hypogonadism and a poor outcome in PCa, we did not use mass-spectrometry-based measurements, recently advocated as the gold standard for sex steroid quantifications [40]. Finally, we lacked data about free and bioavailable testosterone, which were demonstrated to be important in a previous report [31]. The focus was primarily on the pathological findings, but we did not assess biochemical recurrence or prostate cancer-specific mortality, which might be a more important issue than the adverse pathological characteristics to better define progression. In fact, it is well accepted that disease reclassification may be the result of sampling error [41].

In conclusion, men with hypogonadism eligible for AS are at higher risk of disease upgrading and upstaging compared to men with normal serum testosterone levels. These results highlight the utility of evaluating testosterone levels in patients with localized PCa, eligible for AS. Further prospective studies on large populations, with mass-spectrometry-based testosterone measurements and SHBG, luteinizing hormone, oestradiol, free and bioavailable testosterone data are needed to confirm our findings and support the use of circulating sex hormones as prognostic biomarkers in patients eligible for AS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between January 2009 and December 2015, 338 consecutive men were referred for localized PCa, and underwent, within 3 months of diagnosis, laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic RP at three tertiary care institutions (Departments of Urology of the National Cancer Institute “Fondazione Pascale”-Naples, of the University of Catanzaro and of the University of Bari).

Patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the PRIAS protocol [42] defined as: clinical stage T2a or less, PSA < 10 ng/ml, 2 or less cancer involvement cores after a biopsy scheme of at least 12 cores, Gleason score (GS)≤6 and PSA density < 0.2 ng/mL/cc .

Pathological findings in prostate biopsies were compared with pathological specimens after RP.

Reclassification was defined as disease upstaging (pathological stage>pT2) and upgrading (GS ≥ 7; primary Gleason pattern 4). Unfavorable disease was defined as the occurrence of pathological stage>pT2 and predominant Gleason score 4.

RP specimens were processed and evaluated according to the Stanford protocol [43] by three experienced genitourinary pathologists, blinded to the index-tests results of each Institution.

For all patients, at least 12 core biopsies were analyzed according to the 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology recommendations [44]. None of the study patients received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (antiandrogens or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues or antagonists) or other hormonal preparations (i.e., 5-α reductase inhibitors) that could alter their PSA values. We also excluded patients with acute bacterial prostatitis or previous prostate surgery in the 3 months before biopsy. In addition, subjects with chronic renal disease, marked alterations in blood protein levels, hemophilia, incurable endocrine diseases or those who had previously undergone multiple transfusions, were excluded from the study because these conditions could alter the concentration of total PSA and testosterone.

Data collected included age, preoperative PSA level, PSA density, clinical stage and preoperative serum testosterone levels.

The threshold for hypogonadism was set at a total testosterone level of 300 ng/dL, in agreement with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist guidelines [37]. Accordingly, patients were further divided into two groups: 1) low total testosterone group ( < 300 ng/dL) and 2) normal testosterone group (≥300 ng/dL). Clinical stage was assessed by digital rectal examination and magnetic resonance imaging by the attending surgeon according to TNM staging (2009). Disease upstaging was regarded as pathological stage ≥T3a after RP with clinical stage ≤T2c. Prostate cancer upgrading was defined as GS ≥7 in RP specimens with GS ≤6 in needle biopsies.

This study received approval from the local hospital ethics committee (i.e. institutional review board approval). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Hormonal assay
All patients underwent systematic blood sampling between 7 AM and 10 AM on the day before surgery to assess serum total testosterone concentrations.

Electrochemiluminescence immuno-assays, using high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, were performed at the laboratories of the three Institutions, blinded to the pathological results, using Testosterone ElecsysII (Modular Analytics E170 -Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

Statistical analysis
Numerical variables were recorded and analysed as median [25th - 75th percentile] while categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Comparisons between groups were based on the Mann-Whitney or Chi square tests. The predictive accuracy of testosterone was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and quantified in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% C.I.). The independent role of testosterone in predicting pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models; a bootstrap approach, based on 1999 bootstrap replications, was used to compare the percentage change in predictive accuracy (in terms of AUC) between nested logistic models.

Statistical analyses and modelling were performed with R statistical computing software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

This study aimed to investigate the association of interleukin (IL)-10 gene polymorphisms with Behcet’s disease (BD) and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome in the Chinese Han population.

Methods
A two-stage association study was performed on 718 BD patients, 300 VKH patients, and 1,753 controls. Genotyping of the IL-10 gene was performed for six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs3021094, rs3790622, and rs1554286 using PCR-restricted fragment length polymorphism or TaqMan SNP assays. Real-time PCR was performed to test the IL-10 mRNA expression of the associated polymorphisms.

Results
The first-stage result showed significantly increased frequencies of the rs1800871 T allele, rs1800872 A allele, and rs1554286 T allele in BD patients compared with controls (Pcorrected (Pcorr) = 1.82×10−5, OR = 1.837; Pcorr = 6.1×10-5, OR = 1.780; Pcorr = 3.15×10−5, OR = 1.794, respectively). There was no association of the tested six SNPs with VKH syndrome. A second-stage study was therefore performed in BD patients to validate the result of the first stage, showing a significantly increased frequency of the rs1800871 T allele (Second stage, Pcorr = 5.59×10−5, OR = 1.493; Combined data, Pcorr = 3.65×10−11, OR = 1.632). Compared to the controls, an increased frequency of the rs1800871 T allele was observed in BD patients with extraocular findings, including genital ulcers, skin lesions, and a positive pathergy test. No difference was found among the mRNA expressions of IL-10 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of controls with different genotypes of rs1800871 after stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies.

Conclusions
The findings showed that IL-10 is a risk gene for BD but not for VKH syndrome.

Introduction
Behcet’s disease (BD) and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome have been proven as two of the most common and severe sight-threatening uveitis entities in China [1,2]. BD is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral ulcerations, genital ulcerations, recurrent uveitis, and multiple skin lesions [3]. Similar to BD, VKH syndrome is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by bilateral granulomatous panuveitispoliosis, vitiligo, alopecia, and central nervous system and auditory signs [4]. So far, the prevalence of BD or VKH syndrome in China is unclear. Usually, the syndrome occurs more frequently in Turks, Chinese Han, and Japanese individuals, and it is uncommon in Caucasians. Turkey has the highest prevalence rate of BD (80–420 cases per 100,000 persons), whereas the disease is rare in Caucasian (0.27–7.5 cases per 100,000 persons) [5,6]. Although the pathogenesis of the two diseases remains unclear, it is currently thought a genetic predisposition coupled with a triggering event may play a pivotal role in its development [7,8]. Genetic predisposition is an important element, as evidenced by a strong association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system [9-11]. More recently, studies have reported the association of many non-HLA genes with the two diseases, such as endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily C, member 4 (KLRC4), chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 (STAT4) [12-14], interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL23R [15], transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta [16], tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha [17], tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced pro3 (TNFAIP3) [18], and the small ubiquitin-like modifier 4 (SUMO4) [19] gene for BD, as well as IL23R-C1orf141 [20], ZNF365-ADO-EGR2 [20], CTLA-4, and the IL-17 gene for VKH syndrome [21-23]. As many of the proteins involved in the immune response appear to be polymorphic, it can be expected many more gene polymorphisms related to the immune system and its mediators will be identified in the predisposition of inflammatory diseases, such as BD and VKH syndrome.

IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by T lymphocytes (mainly Th2 subsets), B lymphocytes, NK cells, mast cells, eosinophils, dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages [24]. IL-10 was demonstrated to be an important cytokine-suppressing autoimmunity and inflammatory response [25-28]. IL-10 inhibits antigen-presenting cells by downregulating the cell surface expression of HLA molecules [29]. Moreover, it inhibits T cell function by suppressing the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 [30,31]. In addition to these inhibitory actions, IL-10 inhibits naïve T cell differentiation into T helper 17 cells (Th17), as well as promotes the differentiation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) [32]. Gene polymorphisms of IL10 were associated with several immune-related disorders, including Crohn’s disease (CD) [33], type 2 diabetes [34], systemic sclerosis [35], Sjogren’s syndrome [36], and Graves’ disease [37]. Several studies from Iran, Japan, and Turkey have also identified IL-10 as a risk gene for BD [38-40]. These studies have not yet been confirmed in China and we therefore performed a two-stage association study to examine whether IL-10 polymorphisms might also increase the susceptibility of BD and VKH syndrome in our population. We found the IL-10 gene was associated with BD in Chinese Han and in view of the independent confirmation by various independent groups, one may conclude IL-10 definitely plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. On the other hand, IL-10 does not seem to be a susceptibility gene for VKH syndrome.

Methods
Subjects
The first-stage study cohort comprised 300 BD patients, 300 VKH syndrome patients, and 350 normal controls. As well, 418 BD patients and 1,403 normal controls were enrolled in the second stage (Table 1). All subjects were Chinese Han. The patients were continuously diagnosed at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, or the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China between April 2005 and November 2012. The diagnosis of BD was strictly based on the criteria of the International Study Group of BD [41]. The clinical characteristics of BD cases were assessed at the time of diagnosis and are summarized in Table 2. The normal controls consisted of spouses of the patients or accompanying people who had no genetic connection to the patients. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China. Every investigated subject provided informed consent before the collection of blood. The study was in agreement with the ethical principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki.

DNA extraction
Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes and stored at −80 °C until use. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

SNP genotyping
The genotypes of rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs3021094, rs3790622 were examined by PCR-restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The target DNA sequence was amplified by the PCR method with proper primers for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; Table 3). Each PCR was performed in a 7-µl reaction mixture containing 3.5 µl Premix Taq (Promega, Madison), 2 µl water, 0.5 pmol primers, and 0.2 µg genomic DNA for amplification of the DNA. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at different temperatures (60 °C for rs1800871, 59 °C for rs1800872, 56 °C for rs1800896, 55 °C for rs3021094, and 60 °C for rs3790622) for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were respectively digested with 2.5 U of EcoRV, Csp6I, BslI, BglI, and TasI (Fermentas, MBI) for 10–16 h. After digestion, PCR products were visualized on agarose gels at an appropriate concentration. The frequency of a given genotype was estimated by direct counting. In addition, rs1554286 was genotyped by the TaqMan genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on the 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), according to the supplier manual. Details of the TaqMan assay are listed in Table 3. A genotype analysis was performed using TaqMan® Genotyper Software. To confirm the accuracy of the two methods used, we randomly selected 20% of the samples to undergo direct sequencing to validate the results of genotyping by PCR-RFLP and TaqMan (Beijing Liuhe BGI Inc.).

Cell isolation and culture
The healthy study subjects used for the IL-10 gene expression assays were the partners of the patients or an accompanying person, totaling 18 individuals. Peripheral blood samples were obtained using vacuum tubes containing EDTA. Before the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), 1 ml of peripheral blood was stored in 1.5-ml EDTA tubes for genotyping. PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood samples by Ficoll–Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMCs (2×106 cells per well) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured in an RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Greiner, Wemmel, Belgium), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. To detect IL-10 production, PBMCs were stimulated with a mix of the anti-CD3 antibody (5 µg/ml, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and anti-CD28 antibody (1 µg/ml, eBioscience) for 72 h, or 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml; Sigma, MO) for 24 h.

DNA extraction, RNA extraction, and cDNA synthesis
DNA was extracted from whole blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs using TRIzol (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), followed by reverse transcription using a transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems, ABI).

Genotyping and RT-PCR
The genotype of rs1800871 was examined by PCR-RFLP, as mentioned above. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 System (Applied Biosystems) to quantify IL-10 mRNA transcripts. The relative expression level of IL-10 mRNA was normalized by the expression of β-actin mRNA in each sample. Real-time RT-PCR primers were as follows: for IL-10 transcripts, 5′AAGACCCAGACATCAAGGCG3′ (forward) and 5′AATCGATGACAGCGCCGTAG3′ (reverse), and for β-actin, 5′GGATGCAGAAGGAGATCACTG3′ (forward) and 5′CGATCCACACGGAGTACTTG3′ (reverse). Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2—ΔΔCt method.

Statistical analysis
For each SNP, a deviation of genotype frequencies in controls from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was assessed using the chi-square test. No SNPs showed any significant deviation from the HWE (p>0.05). To ensure the accuracy of the genotyping of six SNPs in the investigated subjects, we compared the patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the six SNPs included in the study. Allele frequencies, genotype frequencies, HWE, and LD were calculated using the online platform SHEsis [42]. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls by the chi-square test. Risks were evaluated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The expression of mRNA was analyzed by an independent samples t test. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 (Chicago, IL). P values were corrected (Pcorrected(Pcorr)) for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni correction by multiplying with the number of analyses performed, and Pcorr<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
First-stage study for IL-10 in BD and VKH syndrome
Six SNPs, including rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs3021094, rs3790622, and rs1554286, were successfully genotyped in 300 BD patients, 300 VKH syndrome patients, and 350 healthy controls. The distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of the six SNPs did not deviate from the HWE in the controls.

The frequency of the T allele of rs1800871 was obviously higher in BD patients than in the controls (p = 1.01×10−6, Pcorr = 1.82×10−5, OR = 1.837, 95%CI = 1.437–2.347), whereas the CC genotype frequency was significantly lower in BD patients (p = 4.6×10−7, Pcorr = 8.28×10−6, OR = 0.142, 95%CI = 0.060–0.338). Similar to rs1800871, the frequencies of the C allele of rs1800872 (p = 3.39×10−6, Pcorr = 6.1×10−5, OR = 0.562, 95%CI = 0.440–0.717) and the C allele of rs1554286 (p = 1.75×10−6, Pcorr = 3.15×10−5, OR = 0.558, 95%CI = 0.438–0.709) were lower in BD patients than in healthy controls. Alternatively, the frequencies of the AA genotype of rs1800872 (p = 2.22×10−5, Pcorr = 4.0×10−4, OR = 1.962, 95%CI = 1.435–2.682) and the TT genotype of rs1554286 (p = 1.51×10−6, Pcorr = 2.72×10−5, OR = 2.154, 95%CI = 1.572–2.950) were distinctly higher in BD patients. There was no statistically significant difference concerning the genotypes and alleles of the other three SNPs between patients with BD and the controls (Table 4). The result showed there were no differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of the six SNPs between VKH syndrome patients and controls (Table 5).

Second-stage and combined study for IL-10 in Behcet’s disease
The LD analysis showed the patterns of the SNPs rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3021094, and rs1554286 were strongly linked (Figure 1). In addition, the p value of rs1800871 was the smallest among the aforementioned three positive SNPs in the first-stage study (Table 4). Therefore, we chose rs1800871 to conduct a replication study in an independent cohort including an additional set of 418 BD patients and 1,403 normal controls to confirm further the findings of the first-stage study.

A: The relative positions of the investigated SNPs of IL10 tested in this study (red arrows). B: An LD analysis was performed for SNPs rs1800896, rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3790622, rs3021094, and rs1554286 based on our data using Haploview software version 4.2. The number in the square indicates r2 value.

The second-stage study showed the frequency of the T allele of rs1800871 was significantly higher in BD patients than in controls (p = 3.73×10−6, Pcorr = 5.59×10−5, OR = 1.493, 95%CI = 1.259–1.770). Combining the data of the first-stage and second-stage studies showed that rs1800871 was convincingly associated with a susceptibility to BD (p = 2.03×10−12, Pcorr = 3.65×10−11, OR = 1.632, 95%CI = 1.423–1.872; Table 4).

When the genotype and allele frequencies were analyzed according to the clinical features, the results showed significantly higher frequencies of the rs1800871 T allele in BD patients with extraocular findings, including genital ulcers, skin lesions, and a positive pathergy test, as compared to that observed in healthy controls. There was no difference between BD patients with arthritis and healthy controls (Table 6).

Haplotype analysis of IL-10 SNPs and Behcet’s disease
An LD analysis was performed for six SNPs, including rs1800896, rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3790622, rs3021094, rs1554286, based on our data using Haploview software version 4.2. The results showed that haplotype GACCCA constructed by SNPs rs1554286, rs3021094, rs3790622, rs1800872, rs1800871, and rs1800896 was strongly associated with BD (p = 1.76×10−7; Table 7).

Meta-analysis of three IL-10 SNPs in the Chinese Han population
Recently, Wu et al. reported the association of IL-10 SNPs with BD [43]. In that study, the patients were recruited from the department of rheumatology, and only 28.5% patients had ocular manifestations. In our study, the BD patients were recruited from the department of ophthalmology and 100% of patients had uveitis. Wu et al.’s study included four candidate SNPs, namely rs1800871, rs1518111, rs3021094, and rs3790622. As rs1800871 was in a strong LD with rs1518111, the remaining three SNPs were included in our study. To understand better the association of IL-10 gene polymorphisms and BD in Chinese Han, a meta-analysis was conducted and the results showed rs1800871 and rs3790622 were associated with BD, which is consistent with our study, whereas rs3021094 shows a discrepancy with our study (Figure 2). Further studies using larger samples are needed to address the inconsistent result.

Expression of IL-10 in the PBMCs of controls
The effect of the genotype on the IL-10 mRNA expression was tested in 18 normal genotyped subjects. We tested two individuals with rs1800871 CC, eight individuals with CT, and eight individuals with the TT genotype. After stimulation with LPS, no difference was found concerning the IL-10 mRNA expression by PBMCs in normal controls with different genotypes (Figure 3). Following anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation, a similar trend was evident (Figure 3).

Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the association of six SNPs of IL-10 with two uveitis entities, BD and VKH, in the Chinese Han population. The results showed three IL-10 SNPs, including rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1554286, were significantly associated with BD, but not with VKH syndrome. These three SNPs are in a strong LD with each other, and the IL-10 rs1800871 (−819 C/T) is considered a functional promoter gene. Our findings are in agreement with earlier studies demonstrating a genetic predisposition of certain IL-10 gene polymorphisms and BD in Iranian, Turkish, and Japanese cohorts [38-40]. In these latter studies, an association was found with the SNPs rs1554286, rs1518111, rs1800871, and rs1800872.

Further stratification of samples according to clinical features showed rs1800871 was significantly associated with extraocular findings in our BD patients, including genital ulcers, skin lesions, and a positive pathergy test. No significant association was observed in the group of patients manifesting arthritis. Earlier studies on the analysis of disease outcome showed an association between IL-10 rs1800896 AA homozygosity and poor outcomes in patients with intermediate uveitis [44]. We also included the SNP rs1800896 in our study but did not find a significant association with BD.

Animal models of experimental uveitis have shown IL-10 plays a protective role in the development of uveitis [45,46]. The role of IL-10 in BD is not yet exactly known, although lower levels of IL-10 were found in the aqueous humor of BD patients as compared to other uveitis entities, which indicated the BD intraocular microenvironment lacks immunosuppressive conditions [47]. As of yet, no data have been published concerning IL-10 plasma levels in BD patients.

The choice of IL-10 gene candidate SNPs was based on the associations reported for other autoimmune diseases [33-37]. A study on a Turkish cohort of BD patients identified an association of IL10 rs1518111 with a p value of 1.88×10−8 [40]. We did not use IL-10 rs1518111 in our study, but it is in a strong LD with rs1554286, which was one of the SNPs we used [38]. An association study on patients with white dot syndrome showed IL-10 rs2222202 was associated with multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis with a corrected p value of <0.012, but not in patients with punctate inner choroidopathy [48]. The SNP rs2222202 is linked with the SNP rs1800896 in Chinese Han (D’ = 1.0, r2 = 0.33), and we therefore chose to test the association of SNP rs1800896 with BD.

The three SNPs, including rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1554286, showing an association in our study are in a strong LD with each other. In addition, the p value of rs1800871 was the smallest of the aforementioned three positive SNPs in the first-stage study. We therefore focused on rs1800871 in the second part of our study.

A recent study on IL-10 gene polymorphisms (including rs1800871) in uveitis patients from Austria did not identify a significant association in cases with HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis or with intermediate uveitis [49]. The discrepancy with the association we found for this SNP in BD may be due to disease heterogeneity among different uveitis entities. The SNP rs1800871 is located in the 5′UTR region of IL-10, implying a functional role that regulates its gene expression. An expression analysis did not, however, reveal a significant association between genotype and the IL-10 mRNA expression. We did not include patients in the expression analysis due to confounding factors, such as disease activity and variable immunosuppressive treatment regimens. Our results agree with previous reports that also did not observe significant differences in the levels of IL-10 mRNA among healthy controls with different genotypes of rs1800871 [36]. Nonetheless, they did observe an association between IL-10 genotypes and plasma IL-10 levels in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. A study on patients with H pylori-associated gastritis showed individuals carrying the rs1800871 C allele had higher mucosal IL-10 mRNA expression levels [50]. As mentioned above, such studies have not yet been performed in patients with ocular BD and should be addressed in the future. Furthermore, studies should not only be focused on the mRNA expression of IL-10 but they should also deal with functional immunosuppressive properties of the various IL-10 protein variants.

Unexpectedly, the other three SNPs were not found to be associated with BD, and none of the tested SNPs were found to be associated with VKH syndrome. The number of samples in our study seems to be sufficient to ensure the accuracy of our observations. The absence of an IL-10 gene association was also observed in patients with metabolic syndrome in Taiwan [43], as well as in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients in the German population [44]. These results indicate there is a significant difference in gene susceptibility among different diseases. The inconsistent result between IL-10 SNPs and susceptibility to VKH syndrome and BD may be partly explained by the different etiology and manifestations of these two uveitis entities. VKH syndrome is mediated by an autoimmune response against melanocytes (autoimmune disease), whereas BD is considered mediated by an aberrant response against invading viruses or microbes (autoinflammatory disease) [51,52]. BD is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral ulcerations, genital ulcerations, recurrent uveitis, and multiple skin lesions. VKH syndrome is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by bilateral granulomatous panuveitis, poliosis, vitiligo, alopecia, and central nervous system and auditory signs. To avoid confounding factors, including a selection of patients and healthy controls, as well as ethnic factors, in the results of gene susceptibility to disease in a case-control study, we made several efforts to ensure the accuracy of the results. We paid particular attention to the selection of patients with a definite diagnosis and control individuals to ensure they were from the same ethnic background. To ensure a balance in genotype and allele distributions among the tested patients and the controls, the HWE was examined. Direct sequencing was performed in 20% of the total samples, and the results were in complete accordance with the previous genotyping outcomes.

Taken together, our study confirms the role of IL-10 polymorphisms in BD and suggests a lack of endogenous control of inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our study demonstrated rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1554286 of IL-10 were possibly associated with BD. However, it is unclear whether or how these SNPs play a role in BD. To clarify this issue, further studies should be conducted. Our study found none of the tested six SNPs was associated with VKH syndrome. Considering only six SNPs of the IL-10 gene were tested in this study, it is unclear whether other SNPs of IL-10 are associated with VKH syndrome. Further studies are needed to address this issue.

Background
Several strategies have been previously applied for classifying cervical cytology cells, all pursuing a nucleus segmentation. Sanchez sets regions [1] using a simple threshold [2], a procedure broadly adapted to different techniques: a local adaptive segmentation nuclei procedure [3], seed growing [4], mathematical morphology [5], a Hough transform [6], and active contours [7]. Jantzen and Dounias propose several cell features as morphometric descriptors, including the nucleus and cytoplasm areas, nucleus / cytoplasm proportion, nucleus and cytoplasm brightnesses, smaller and larger nucleus/cytoplasm diameters, nucleus and cytoplasm roundness, nucleus and cytoplasm perimeters, nucleus position, nucleus/cytoplasm maxima and minima. Nevertheless, these morphometric characteristics require a previous accurate segmentation, hardly achieved by human intervention using commercial software such as CHAMP (Cytology and Histology Modular Analysis Package, Aarhus, Denmark) or DIMAC (Digital Image Company) [8,9].

Methods
Rather than attempting to detect some of the previously reported morphometric features, the present investigation used two global MPEG-7 color descriptors, Color Layout and Scalable Color, and one texture descriptor, the Edge Histogram descriptor, as the representation space and two supervised classification algorithms (SVM and KNN) that divide the different classes.

Classification based on global MPEG-7 descriptors
The cell classification approach is carried out using color and texture MPEG-7 descriptors, thereby attempting to capture information related with the particular color spatial location and global color distribution of both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The texture descriptor stands for the particular borders of both nucleus and cytoplasm and their intrinsic relationships. These global characteristics are not evaluating the classical morphometric features, but they are using nucleus and cytoplasm visual primitives as discriminant factors.

Color layout
This descriptor, typically used in the YCrCb color space, captures the spatial color distribution in an image or an arbitrary region. Basically, the color layout descriptor uses representative colors on an grid, followed by a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and an encoding of the resulting coefficients. The feature extraction process consists of two parts; grid based representative color selection and DCT transform with quantization. Specifically, an input image is divided into 64 blocks, their average colors are derived and transformed into a series of coefficients by performing a conventional DCT. A few low-frequency coefficients are selected using zigzag scanning and quantized to form a Color Layout Descriptor [10].

Scalable color
This descriptor is extracted from a color image histogram in the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space. This histogram, constructed with fixed color space quantization, is projected into a set of Haar bases so that the obtained coefficients constitute a scalable color representation. The histogram values must be normalized and non linearly mapped into a 4-bit integer representation, giving higher weight to small values. The Haar transform is applied then to this histogram version with two basic operators: sum and difference bin neighbor, decomposing the histogram into low and high frequency subbands [10].

Edge histogram
This descriptor captures the spatial edge distribution, a very useful feature for image matching, even though the underlying texture may not be homogeneous. A given image is first sub-divided into sub-images and local edge histograms, for each of these sub-images, are computed. Edges are then coarsely grouped into five categories: vertical, horizontal, 45 diagonal, 135 diagonal, and isotropic (nonorientation specific). Thus, each local histogram has five bins corresponding to the above five categories. The image partitioned into 16 sub-images results in 80 bins. These bins are nonuniformly quantized using 3 bits/bin, resulting in a descriptor with size of 240 bits [10].

Classification models
The classification method used a classical K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and a Support Vector Machine.. The proposed approach was evaluated under a 10-fold experimental setup.

The k-NN decision rule
The k-nearest neighbor method is an intuitive method that classifies unlabeled samples based on their similarity with samples in the training set. Given the knowledge of N prototype features (vectors of dimension ∑) and their correct classification into M classes, the k-NN rule assigns an unclassified pattern to the class that is most heavily represented among its k neighbors in the pattern space, under some appropriate metric. In this work euclidean distance was used.

The SVM algorithm
A support vector machine (SVM) is a classification model that finds an optimal separating hyperplane that discriminates two classes. A SVM is a linear discriminator, however it can perform non-linear discriminations thanks to the fact that this is a kernel method. In this work, it is used a SVM version that uses sequential minimal optimization algorithm. The multi-class classification problem is solved using a one vs. all strategy: a binary classifier for each class by labeling the class samples as positive examples and other class samples as negative ones. The final decision is set to the class having the largest decision function among all classes.

Results and discussion
Database
Two databases composed of images with single cells, from the Herlev University Hospital, Denmark, were used (http://labs.fme.aegean.gr/decision/downloads). Skilled cyto-technicians and doctors manually classified each cell in 2 classes: abnormal and normal and then subclassified into seven classes. Each cell was examined by two cyto-technicians, and difficult samples also by a doctor. In case of disagreement, the sample was simply discarded (Byriel, Martin, Norup, Jantzen). Finally there are two database:

B_1 data contains 500 cells with the following distribution:

1. Normal: columnar epithelial, parabasal squamous epithelial, intermediate squamous epithelial, superficial squamous epithelial.

2. Abnormal: mild squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, moderate squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, severe squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia.

The B_2 data contains 917 cells with the following distribution:

1. Normal: superficial squamous epithelial, intermediate squamous epithelial, columnar epithelial..

2. Abnormal: mild squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, moderate squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, severe squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma in situ intermediate.

Experimental Setup
Two classification algorithms were assessed (KNN and SVM). Each classification model was tuned independently for its own particular set of parameters as follows: k-NN was assessed by varying the k nearest neighbors between 1 and 15 with increment steps of two. SVM used two kernel types were evaluated; radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial functions. For the RBF kernel, the γ parameter was varied from 0.00 to 0.90 with increment steps of 0.10, while the polynomial kernel degree was set at 1, 2 and 3. The regularization parameter Complexity 1.0. Evaluation was carried out with both 2-class (normal and anormal) problems. A conventional 10-fold cross validation was performed for every parameter combination.

Results
The effects of different levels of complexity were evaluated, but do not show important variations. Figure 1 shows the percentage error for the method proposed in the 2- class problem for B_1 datasets. Better performance was achieved by the KNN classifier with k 15. The B_2 database shows the performance of SVM with radial base kernel, for values of 0.01 (Figure 2). In both database these results were obtained with the edge histogram descriptor.

Discussion
A new strategy for assisting the diagnosis of pap smears which requires no segmentation was proposed, implemented and evaluated. Instead of attempting to segment cells and its structural components, we propose to characterize the internal cell structure using well known MPEG-7 global descriptors. Results are very promising, however evaluation of other specific features and classification algorithms can improve the classification performance.

Conclusions
This work presented an original method for discrimination of each class: normal and abnormal. Future work is to evaluate the classification of the seven classes.

Tracking of replicative senescence is of fundamental relevance in cellular therapy. Cell preparations – such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) - undergo continuous changes during culture expansion, which is reflected by impaired proliferation and loss of differentiation potential. This process is associated with epigenetic modifications: during in vitro culture, cells acquire senescence-associated DNA methylation (SA-DNAm) changes at specific sites in the genome. We have recently described an Epigenetic-Senescence-Signature that facilitates prediction of the state of cellular aging by analysis of DNAm at six CpG sites (associated with the genes GRM7, CASR, PRAMEF2, SELP, CASP14 and KRTAP13-3), but this has not yet been proven over subsequent passages and with MSCs isolated under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions.

Findings
MSCs were isolated from human bone marrow and GMP-conform expanded for up to 11 passages. Cumulative population doublings (cPDs) and long-term growth curves were calculated based on cell numbers at each passage. Furthermore, 32 cryopreserved aliquots of these cell preparations were retrospectively analyzed using our Epigenetic-Senescence-Signature: DNAm-level was analyzed at six specific CpGs, and the results were used to estimate cPDs, time of culture expansion, and passage numbers. Overall, predicted and real parameters revealed a good correlation, particularly in cPDs. Based on predicted cPDs we could reconstruct long-term growth curves and demonstrated the continuous increase in replicative senescence on molecular level.

Conclusion
Epigenetic analysis of specific CpG sites in the genome can be used to estimate the state of cellular aging for quality control of therapeutic cell products.

Findings
Mesenchymal stromal cells are usually culture expanded for clinical application. Yet, cells undergo tremendous changes during long-term culture: they enlarge, acquire flat “fried-egg” morphology, lose differentiation potential, and ultimately stop proliferation [1,2]. This phenomenon has already been described over 50 years ago by Leonhard Hayflick [3]. It is important to note that functional changes - including loss of colony-forming units, as well as adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential - become already evident during early passages [4]. There is also evidence that secretory and immunomodulatory functions of MSCs change upon in vitro expansion [5]. Furthermore, cells in culture may be more prone to mutations – and hence, malignant transformation [6,7]. This conflicts with the high demands for standardization and safety in regenerative medicine. Therefore, it is important to monitor replicative senescence in long-term culture of MSCs [8].

Analysis of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity is the most widely used biomarker for replicative senescence in vitro[9]. We observed that it is particularly detected in very late, senescent passages [10], although other authors indicated that it is also up-regulated earlier in culture [11,12]. Furthermore, SA-β-Gal may also be induced upon stress during in vitro culture [13] but this analysis does not facilitate reliable estimation of cumulative population doublings (cPDs). Telomere attrition has also been correlated with replicative potential, but the results vary between different cell types and culture methods [14-16]. Analysis of cPDs necessitates precise cell counting at each passage throughout culture expansion. So far, the state of cellular aging could not be determined retrospectively without this information.

Culture expansion of MSCs is associated with senescence-associated DNA-methylation (SA-DNAm) changes at specific sites in the genome which become either hyper-methylated or hypo-methylated [17,18]. These senescence-associated CpG sites are enriched in developmental genes and they correlate with repressive histone marks [19]. The mechanism regulating these SA-DNAm changes is yet unclear – it is possible that they resemble a kind of epigenetic drift, similar to observations in aging of the organism [20]. On the other hand, we have recently demonstrated that almost the entire set of SA-DNAm is reversed by reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) indicating that the process can be reversed by the pluripotent state [21]. It is also unknown if SA-DNAm changes entail the profound functional changes during culture expansion, or if they rather resemble a byproduct. Either way, SA-DNAm changes are highly reproducible and may therefore be used to monitor cellular senescence. To this end, we have elaborated an Epigenetic-Aging-Signature based on six specific CpG sites which seemed to display consistent SA-DNAm changes in different cell preparations. Integration of these DNAm levels in linear-regression models facilitated prediction of passage number, cPDs, and days of in vitro culture [22]. Yet, this method required further validation – particularly on cell preparations isolated under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions. So far, the method has not been used with cells isolated in serial passages and with DNA directly isolated from cryopreserved cell aliquots. Therefore, we performed the following retrospective study:

MSCs were isolated from human bone marrow of the iliac crest of three different heart patient donors after full informed consent with ethical approval by the Ethical Committee from the University Hospital Erasme of the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB; aggregation number N°OM021) and cultivated as described before [23]. In brief, cells were cultured at 37°C in Advanced Minimal Essential Medium (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) supplemented with 5% human platelet lysate (Mill Creek Life Science, Rochester, MN, USA), Glutamax™ (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). After 24 h, non-adherent bone marrow and cellular debris were removed and adherent mesenchymal cells were expanded using cell seeding densities varying between 2,000 and 6,000 cells/cm2. After the initial passages cultures were split into parallel subcultures, cultivated for several passages and in some cases subcultured for a second time (Figure 1A). Upon several amplification rounds cells were treated with C3BS proprietary cardiotrophic cocktail containing additional growth factors. Post-cocktail treatment, cells were cultured for a minimum of two additional passages or until growth arrest was observed. At each passage, cell numbers and seeding density have been carefully documented. Based on these numbers we calculated long-term growth curves (Figure 1B). MSCs of all three donors stopped proliferation after about 30 cPDs. Even when the culture was split and further cultured independently, there was only a slight deviation in the maximal number of cPDs which might either be due to the outgrowth of different subfractions or deviations in cell counting.

Figure 1 Epigenetic-Senescence-Signature during long-term culture of MSCs. (A) MSCs were isolated form bone marrow (BM) of three patients and sub-cultured during expansion as indicated by the hierarchical trees. (B) Long-term growth curves reveal that cell growth decayed within 30 cumulative population doublings (cPDs). Black triangles indicate subculturing as mentioned above. (C) DNAm analysis at six senescence-associated CpG sites was then performed in various cryopreserved vials by pyrosequencing [22,24]. Based on these results we calculated predictions for cPDs, days of in vitro culture and passage numbers. These predictions were subsequently compared to real values. (D) Predictions for cPDs, as determined using the Epigenetic-Aging-Signature, were plotted against real culture time to simulate long-term growth curves. Overall, the results correspond to real long-term growth curves even with regard to different subcultures (symbols as depicted in B).

Thirty-two cryopreserved samples, which correspond to various passages of the three donors, were then analyzed using the Epigenetic-Senescence-Signature to estimate the state of cellular aging. In our previous work, we did not analyze many subsequent passages from the same cell preparation and harvested DNA directly from cells in culture. DNA was now isolated from cryopreserved vials without taking cells into culture and then bisulfite-converted. SA-DNAm of the six relevant CpGs was analyzed in a blinded manner by pyrosequencing as described in detail before (performed at Varionostic GmbH, Ulm, Germany) [22,24]. In brief, two CpGs become continuously hyper-methylated in long-term culture (associated with the genes GRM7 and CASR) and four CpGs become hypo-methylated (corresponding to PRAMEF2, SELP, CASP14 and KRTAP13-3). DNAm values of each sample were then used for linear regression analysis to predict cPDs, passage number and days of in vitro culture. An online-calculator is provided under: http://www.molcell.rwth-aachen.de/dms/. It needs to be noted that the genes associated with the six relevant CpGs are not expressed in MSCs [22]. In fact, there are highly reproducible changes in gene expression profiles during long-term culture [10,25] but this seems to be hardly related to SA-DNAm changes [17,21]. Thus, there is no direct association of the Epigenetic-Senescence-Signature with well-known pathways of senescence [26] – it is a suitable biomarker but the functional relevance is yet unclear.

Overall, the predictions for cPDs, days of in vitro culture and passage numbers correlated well with real parameters, although they were slightly overestimated (Figure 1C). The best correlation was observed with cPDs which may be not surprising – passage numbers resemble a rather imprecise measure which is greatly affected by handling in cell culture, whereas cultivation-time is interdependent on donor-specific differences in cell growth. Overestimation of the state of cellular aging might be attributed to operational procedures in cell culture or to systematic deviation in cell counting. On the other hand, differences in starting material and culture conditions may have significant impact on replicative senescence during culture expansion, too, and this may necessitate further adaptation of the differential equations. Particularly samples of donor 3 revealed a low correlation and a different slope of predicted versus real parameters. This supports the notion that there are differences in the state of cellular senescence between cell preparations which are not necessarily reflected by long-term growth curves. Subsequently, we simulated long-term growth curves based on the predicted values for cPDs. As mentioned above, different subcultures reached slightly different maximal cPDs. The same tendencies were also observed epigenetically: subcultures which reached more real cPDs were also estimated to have reached more cPDs using the Epigenetic-Aging-Signature (Figure 1D). This indicates that the differences are indeed cell-intrinsic and not due to deviations in cell counting.

There is a growing perception that standardized protocols and quality control of therapeutic cell preparations are a prerequisite for reliable and reproducible cellular therapy. Given the major impact of long-term culture on molecular changes in MSCs it is very likely that this process has also impact on the therapeutic potential. Clinical outcome should therefore be evaluated in the context of cellular aging. In this short report, we provide further evidence that this can be tracked by specific epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic analysis may be used as a tool to validate cell counts and sampling in the course of long-term culture of MSCs – which is a time consuming and error prone procedure – and it is of particular relevance if detailed cell numbers have not been documented throughout expansion. We demonstrate that our Epigenetic-Senescence-Signature reflects inter-individual differences and variation in subpopulations which are not necessarily reflected in conventional long-term growth curves. In this regard, the epigenetic state of cell preparations might even provide the more accurate measurement for the biological state of cellular aging. Furthermore, it will be interesting to investigate if molecules secreted by senescent cells, a phenomenon termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), affect also the epigenetic state of cells in culture [27,28]. Our method facilitates analysis of continuously cultured cells as well as retrospective analysis of cryopreserved residual vials [22]. Cryopreservation is commonly performed in many labs and clinical trials – even though this process makes a selection because, after thawing, not all cells grow out. On the other hand, applicability on such retained samples, which are usually collected in clinical trials, now opens new perceptive to gain better insight in the impact of long-term culture on clinical outcome. In the future, it would therefore be interesting to analyze SA-DNAm samples in therapeutic cellular products and to correlate the results with clinical performance.

Ethnic differences in childhood and adulthood are known, but ethnic differences in preschool overweight and associated factors are less studied. We assessed ethnic differences in pre-school age overweight, and studied the mediating role of early life factors in this association. Furthermore, we assessed body mass index (BMI) z-score development from birth to age 4 years to study ethnic-specific differences in BMI z-score trajectory.

Methods
We used data on 4581 children participating in a birth cohort who were born between 2002 and 2006 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Child’s ethnicity was defined according to country of birth of the parents. Weight and length/height was repeatedly measured between 1 and 45 months of age. Overweight at age 4 years was defined according to cut-off points for BMI from the international obesity task force. We performed logistic regression to obtain independent estimates of the association between ethnicity and preschool-age overweight, and to assess the mediating role of early life risk factors. Mixed models were used to describe BMI-z development for each ethnic group from birth to preschool age.

Results
Relative to native Dutch children, non-Dutch children were more likely to be overweight at age 4 years, except for Surinamese-Hindustani children. Socio-demographic factors, parental BMI, and infant weight change in the first 6 months after birth reduced associations. After full adjustment, Turkish (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.34-3.04) and Antillean/Surinamese Creole (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.06-3.02) children were still more likely to be overweight at age 4 years.

Conclusion
Ethnic differences on the prevalence of overweight in preschool children can be partially explained by maternal educational level, parental overweight and early infant weight change. These may be possible targets to reduce ethnic inequalities in preschool age overweight.

Background
Throughout the developed world, childhood overweight is increased in ethnic minority groups. In the USA, childhood overweight prevalence is higher among Blacks and Hispanics than among Caucasians
[1]; and in the UK, overweight prevalence is higher among South-Asian and African-Caribbean children, although inconsistencies arise when different definitions of overweight are used
[2]. Studies from Australia, Germany and the Netherlands also report that certain ethnic groups have a higher prevalence of childhood overweight
[3-5]. It is important to elucidate these ethnic differences in childhood overweight in order to take measures to prevent overweight in these groups. Ethnic differences in overweight have been reported to be present from preschool age onwards
[3,5,6]. This suggests that factors responsible for ethnic differences in overweight act in early life. Indeed, one study reported ethnic differences in several risk factors (including infant feeding, sugar-sweetened beverages, and mother's feeding practices) in preschool children, but this study did not assess the contribution of these risk factors to ethnic inequalities in overweight
[7].

We assessed ethnic differences in pre-school age overweight, and studied the mediating role of risk factors that were present before overweight was developed (‘early life factors’) in this association. We distinguished these early life factors into parental, prenatal, and postnatal factors in order to get clues which of these factors can be targets for preventive interventions. Furthermore, we assessed body mass index (BMI) z-score development from birth to age 4 years to study ethnic-specific differences in BMI z-score trajectory.

Methods
Study design
This study was embedded in Generation R, a population-based multi-ethnic prospective cohort study from fetal life onwards. Invitations to participate in the study were made to all pregnant mothers who had an expected delivery date between 2002 and 2006 and who lived in the study area (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Details of the study are described elsewhere
[8].

The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines proposed in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee at Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam. Written consent was obtained from all participants.

Study population
Consent for postnatal follow-up was available for 7893 children. We excluded twins from the analyses (n = 197). To avoid clustering, our analyses excluded data on the second or third pregnancy of any woman who was participating in the Generation R study with more than one child (n = 580). We excluded participants of whom we missed ethnicity (n = 657). Children who had less than 4 measures on height or weight were excluded (n = 734), as they were often lacking data on later overweight. In total, data of 5725 subjects were available for analyses. Children with a European (n = 466), Indonesian (n = 76), Asian western (n = 5), Asian non-Western (n = 161), American Western (n = 30), American non-Western (n = 84), Oceania (n = 10), African (n = 118) and Surinamese-other (n = 194) ethnicity were excluded from the analyses because of their small sample size and heterogeneity (n = 1144). After exclusion of these, the study sample consisted of 4581 children.

Measurements
Child’s ethnicity
We used the standard definition of Statistics Netherlands as a basis for defining ethnic background. This definition is based on country of birth of the parents
[9], which we extended to country of birth of parents and grandparents. A child was considered as having an immigrant background if one of both parents was born abroad. If both parents were born abroad, but in different countries, mother’s country of birth was leading. We also take third generation immigrants into account: if both parents were born in the Netherlands, but at least two grandparents of the same parent were born abroad, the child was assigned ethnicity of these grandparents. Also, children with one parent born abroad, but four grandparents born in the Netherlands, were assigned a Dutch ethnicity. All possible combinations and their consequences for assignment of child’s ethnicity are described in Additional file
1.

We initially distinguished six ethnic groups according to country of birth. Surinamese children were further subdivided according to self-assigned ethnicity of the mother because different ethnicities live in that country. We performed analyses on 3126 native Dutch, 474 Turkish, 351 Moroccan, 199 Cape Verdean, 295 Antillean/Surinamese-Creole, and 136 Surinamese-Hindustani children (n = 4581).

BMI and overweight
Length (to 24 months)/height (from 24 months) and weight were measured according to a standard schedule and procedures by a well-trained staff at each visit to the child health centre. Length was measured in supine position to the nearest millimetre until the age of 24 months using a neonatometer, after which height was measured in standing position by a Harpenden stadiometer (Holtain Limited, Dyfed, U.K.). Weight was measured using a mechanical personal scale to the nearest 0.01 kg (SECA, Hamburg, Germany). A child usually visits the child health center that is assigned according to postal code. Routine visits at the child health centers are scheduled around 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 45 months of age. BMI was calculated as weight/height2. BMI-for-age z-scores were derived from national growth curves
[10]. We used the age and gender specific cut-off points of the International Obesity Task Force to define overweight
[11].

Covariates
Socio-demographic variables
All socio-demographic variables were assessed by questionnaire at study enrollment. Household income was dichotomized (< € 1600 per month, ≥ € 1600 per month). Households that earn below this cut-off point are considered as low-income groups
[12]. Level of maternal education was established at enrollment
[13]. The mothers were classified into three educational categories according to the highest level of education they had attained: low (no education; primary school; lower vocational training; intermediate general school; or three years general secondary school); middle (>3 years general secondary school; intermediate vocational training; or first year of higher vocational training), and high (higher vocational training; or Bachelor’s degree, higher academic education). The following question was asked to determine material hardship: ‘Do you have any difficulty in paying food, rent, electricity bill and such like?’ Answer categories included ‘no’ (no), ‘some’ (yes), and ‘great’ (yes) difficulties. Single motherhood (yes, no) was obtained by questionnaire.

Parental characteristics
Mother’s BMI was calculated from self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height at enrollment. Father’s BMI was calculated from measured weight and height at enrollment. Smoking during pregnancy (yes, no) was derived from the three prenatal questionnaires (1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester).

Birth characteristics
Birth weight (grams) and gestational age (weeks) were obtained from medical records.

Postnatal factors
Information on breastfeeding was obtained by a combination of questionnaires administered at 2, 6 and 12 months after birth. Questions included items on the proportion of breastfeeding relative to infant formula, breastfeeding duration, and number of daily feedings. Breastfeeding was defined as having received any (including non-exclusive) breastfeeding for 6 months. Infant weight change was defined as the difference in BMI between birth and six months of age.

Statistical analyses
We assessed characteristics of participants for the total population and for each ethnicity separately. P-values for differences in risk factors for overweight between ethnic groups were calculated by means of the Chi-square test for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables.

First, we performed logistic regression to obtain independent estimates of the association between ethnicity (reference: 'Dutch') and preschool overweight, and to assess the mediating role of early life risk factors. We built our models in the following steps. First, we assessed the association between ethnicity and childhood overweight, adjusted for age and sex (model 1). Then, we adjusted separately for the socio-demographic variables: household income, mother’s educational level, and material hardship (model 2), other parental variables: parental BMI and maternal smoking during pregnancy (model 3), birth characteristics: birth weight and gestational age (model 4), and postnatal risk factors: breastfeeding and infant weight gain (model 5) to show the mediating role of each of these groups on the association between ethnicity and overweight. Lastly, we adjusted for all variables simultaneously (model 6).

To prevent bias, loss of information and enhance comparison between models, we applied multiple imputation in SPSS v17.0 on the early life risk factors to this analysis
[14,15]. The missing values for the covariates ranged from 0% (birth weight, gestational age) to 40% (infant weight gain). The number of missing values were higher for non-Dutch participants for the variables father’s BMI, household income, material hardship and breastfeeding. We assumed the missings to be random (MAR). Five imputed datasets and their pooled estimates were generated using a fully conditional specified model to handle missing values. Imputations were based on the relations between all covariates in the study. We used the pooled estimates from these five imputed datasets to report odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Second, repeated measurements analysis ('PROC MIXED' procedure in SAS) was performed to calculate whether BMI z-score curves differ per ethnicity throughout the first 4 years of life. This analysis takes into account that data are correlated within one individual. The best fitting model for BMI as a function of age was built using fractional polynomials. The best fitting model for BMI z-score was BMIZ = ß0 + ß1*(ln)age + ß2*√age. To this model we added ethnicity as a main determinant (reference: Dutch), and an interaction term of ethnicity with both transformations of age. We modeled the BMI z-score development of each ethnic group for the total population and stratified for overweight and normal weight children. The best model for the subsamples was: BMIZ = ß0 + ß1*age + ß2*√age.

Analyses were conducted with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 9.1.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US) was used for the repeated measurements analyses (mixed procedure).

Results
Sample characteristics
Ethnic differences were present in all covariates (Table 
1). Generally, non-Dutch mothers were lower educated, had a lower household income, suffered more often from material hardship, and were more often single (p < 0.001) compared to native Dutch mothers. The direction of differences in father’s BMI, smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding, birth weight and gestational age varied according to ethnic subgroup (Table 
1). Prevalence of overweight between 2 and 4 years was about 10%. Relative to Dutch children whose overweight prevalence varied between 10 and 12% between ages 2 to 4, overweight prevalence was consistently higher in Moroccan (14-21%, p < 0.001) and Turkish (21-28%, p < 0.001) children, and lower in Surinamese-Hindustani children (0-8%, p < 0.001) (Table 
1).

Contribution of risk factors in explaining ethnic overweight differences
Of the 4581 children in the study population, 2994 (65%) had measured weight and height at the last scheduled visit in the child health centers (around 45 months of age). Unadjusted analyses showed that all non-Dutch groups, except the Surinamese-Hindustani children, were more likely to be overweight at age 4 (Table 
2, model 1). Adjustment for mother's educational level (model 2), parental BMI (model 3), and infant weight change (model 5) attenuated the associations, with the strongest attenuation after adjusting for mother's educational level. In contrast, perinatal factors strengthened associations (model 4). After full adjustment (model 6), only Turkish (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.34-3.04) and Antillean/Surinamese-Creole (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.06-3.02) ethnicity were independently associated with overweight at age 4. Associations between Moroccan and Cape Verdean ethnicity and preschool overweight at age 4 were not statistically significant after full adjustment for early life risk factors.

Model 1: adjusted for age and sex.

Model 2: adjusted for sex, age, and socio-demographics (household income, mother's education, material hardship).

Model 3: adjusted for sex, age, and parental (parental BMI, maternal smoking during pregnancy).

Model 4: adjusted for sex, age, and birth characteristics (birth weight and gestational age).

Model 5: adjusted for sex, age, and postnatal factors (breastfeeding, infant weight gain).

Model 6: adjusted for all variables in model 1–5 simultaneously.

The analysis based on the imputed and not imputed data revealed the same early life overweight risk factors for model 1–5 (see Additional file
2). For the final model (model 6), the risk factors for overweight slightly differed. Both methods revealed paternal BMI, birth weight, and infant weight change as risk factors. In the imputed data, educational level, mother’s BMI, gestational age, and breastfeeding were risk factors for childhood overweight. Although the effect estimates pointed in similar directions, these factors were not statistically significant.

The association between ethnicity and overweight followed a similar pattern for the not imputed data; after adjustment for the socio-demographic, parental, and postnatal factors the association between ethnicity and overweight was attenuated, while adjustment for the perinatal factors strengthened the association.

BMI development in ethnic groups
We assessed BMI development without any of the explanatory variables in the model to study specific time periods in which BMI differences between ethnic groups could occur. The BMI development model indicated differences in BMI development between ethnic subgroups (p-value for ethnicity: 0.007, p-value for ethnicity*ln(age): <0.0001, p-value for ethnicity*√age: <0.0001). All non-Dutch ethnic groups except for Surinamese-Hindustani children, had a higher BMI z-score from 1 month of age onwards (Figure 
1). Development of BMI z-score was similar for all ethnic groups, as indicated. This was also the case when restricting the sample to normal weight children (Figure 
2), but BMI z-score was lower in Cape Verdean and Antillean/Surinamese-Creole children at the time preschool age was reached. Also, Antillean/Surinamese-Creole overweight children had a steeper increase in BMI z-score in early life than the other ethnic groups (Figure 
3).

Discussion
Main findings
This study shows that relative to native Dutch children, non-Dutch children are more likely to develop overweight at a very young age, with the exception of Surinamese-Hindustani children. BMI differences are already present in early postnatal life, and develop in a persistent way to preschool age. Mother's educational level, higher parental BMI, and a larger infant BMI change between birth and 6 months of age were important contributors in explaining the higher prevalence of overweight in non-Dutch children.

Interpretation
The results of our study are consistent with the findings of a study that reported a higher prevalence of overweight in Turkish and Moroccan children from the age of 3 years onwards
[3,6]. Similar findings were also reported in Australia for Mediterranean white children from the age of 5 years onwards
[5]. In contrast to the results of Whitaker and Orzol, who concluded that the higher prevalence of overweight in Hispanic children could not be explained by maternal education, household income or food security, our study showed a large contribution of maternal educational level
[16]. This may be due to the difference in country-specific ethnicities, and underlying history of migration. In our study, parental BMI and infant weight change also explained part of the association between ethnicity and childhood overweight. Another Dutch birth cohort study reported similar contributing factors
[17]. Rapid infant weight gain is a well-established risk factor for later overweight
[18]. Gain in infant BMI between birth and 6 months might be driven by infant feeding practices. Woo et al. reported that breastfeeding (comparing those receiving any breastfeeding for 4 months versus those receiving any breastfeeding for less than 4 months) mediates the association between ethnicity and overweight in adolescents
[19]. Although breastfeeding was a strong determinant of overweight in our study, we did not see a mediating effect of breastfeeding on the association between ethnicity and overweight until age 4 years. The protective effect of breastfeeding on overweight may express at a later age. Also, we did not study complementary feeding. It has been reported that some ethnic groups do not adhere to the feeding recommendations, which may result in overfeeding
[20,21]. Cultural differences may play an important role in overfeeding, as a ‘chubby’ baby is often seen as the most healthy baby in some ethnic groups
[22]. Thus, part of the association may be due to feeding practices other than breastfeeding that is reflected in faster infant weight gain. However, determinants of infant weight gain can also be genetic or based on developmental factors during pregnancy
[23,24].

Study limitations and strengths
Strengths of this study were the longitudinal design with repeated measurements of BMI and the homogeneous ethnic groups. However, ethnicity is not a standardized, well-defined concept. It refers to people belonging to the same nation, religion, language, country of birth, or culture
[25]. We used country of birth because it is the most objective and stable measure that can be used in young children. Nevertheless, country of birth does not cover all aspects of ethnicity, such as culture and ethnic identity
[26]. Also, we categorized the children of mixed ethnicity according to ethnic background of the mother’s family, which may have attenuated our results. Future studies could give the associations between several aspects of ethnicity and overweight.

We used BMI as an indicator of overweight and obesity. BMI is a measure of excess weight rather than of excess fat. Fat percentage may differ for BMI levels among ethnic subgroups: this is especially the case in Asians
[2]. However, there are no specific cut-off points available for Asians to define overweight and obesity according to the BMI
[27]. DXA measures for this cohort will become available in the future.

Lastly, the percentages of mothers from ethnic minorities are lower among the participants than expected from the population data in Rotterdam
[28]. This could have led to selection bias if associations between ethnicity and overweight are different for those who participate compared to those who do not participate. Although this is unlikely and associations are probably unaffected, overweight prevalence may not be generalized to the ethnic minority population. Also, a substantial number of values in the covariates were missing, and non-Dutch participants had a higher number of missing values for some of the covariates; however, on the assumption that these are missing at random (i.e. missings may be correlated with variables in the model, but may not be correlated with variables not in the model) they are unlikely to have caused selection bias. We assume missing at random because associations between covariates and overweight were in expected directions, as reported in earlier studies. Also, associations between ethnicity and overweight were in similar direction as a previous Dutch study
[17]. In addition, despite the loss of power in the not imputed data, the interpretation of the imputed and not imputed data was similar.

Conclusion
This study shows that ethnic inequalities in preschool-age overweight have their origins in factors that operate before (maternal educational level), during (parental BMI), and after (infant weight change) pregnancy. After birth, BMI development was fairly similar between ethnic groups. Maternal educational level, parental BMI, and infant weight change explained part of the ethnic differences in childhood overweight. Therefore, in order to reduce ethnic inequalities in childhood overweight, prevention programs should start in the earliest stage of pregnancy. Future research should clarify the underlying behavioral factors of ‘maternal education’ , ‘parental BMI’ , and ‘infant weight change’.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Although wrist-type photoplethysmographic (hereafter referred to as WPPG) sensor signals can measure heart rate quite conveniently, the subjects’ hand movements can cause strong motion artifacts, and then the motion artifacts will heavily contaminate WPPG signals. Hence, it is challenging for us to accurately estimate heart rate from WPPG signals during intense physical activities. The WWPG method has attracted more attention thanks to the popularity of wrist-worn wearable devices. In this paper, a mixed approach called Mix-SVM is proposed, it can use multi-channel WPPG sensor signals and simultaneous acceleration signals to measurement heart rate. Firstly, we combine the principle component analysis and adaptive filter to remove a part of the motion artifacts. Due to the strong relativity between motion artifacts and acceleration signals, the further denoising problem is regarded as a sparse signals reconstruction problem. Then, we use a spectrum subtraction method to eliminate motion artifacts effectively. Finally, the spectral peak corresponding to heart rate is sought by an SVM-based spectral analysis method. Through the public PPG database in the 2015 IEEE Signal Processing Cup, we acquire the experimental results, i.e., the average absolute error was 1.01 beat per minute, and the Pearson correlation was 0.9972. These results also confirm that the proposed Mix-SVM approach has potential for multi-channel WPPG-based heart rate estimation in the presence of intense physical exercise.

1. Introduction
Heart rate estimation can provide useful information for users who are engaged in rehabilitation or in physical exercise and anyone who wants to routinely keep track of their cardiac status. Traditional heart rate estimation mainly relies on electrocardiogram (ECG), but ECG requires the presence of ground and reference sensors that must be attached to the body. That is to say, its application area was limited because of the high hardware complexity and low user comfort ability. Photoplethysmography (PPG) [1,2] was widely used for measuring blood volume changes in tissue due to its non-invasive nature and low cost. Unfortunately, the quality of PPG sensor signals can be easily affected by motion artifacts during intensive physical exercise. Therefore, the motion artifacts must be removed to measure heart rate accurately [3,4,5].

In order to improve the quality of PPG sensor signals with motion artifacts, researchers have conducted several explorations to address the above problem, including adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) [6,7,8], singular value decomposition [9], time and period domain analysis [10], wavelet-based method [11,12], blind source separation (BBS) [13], spectrum subtraction [14], empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [15,16], Kalman filtering [17], and Wigner-Ville distribution [18], to name a few. However, the above methods can work well under mild-movement conditions only where motion artifacts are not strong (walking, jogging, finger movements).

Lately, Lopez-Silva et al. [19] proposed a heuristic algorithm, its first step was the linear filtering of WPPG signal via band-pass Bessel filtering to get the pulsating component and to suppress high-frequency noise and ripples. Then a frequency-domain analysis was performed by applying the FFT. Finally, a peak search algorithm was applied to the stream of spectra to select peaks that are above the noise floor. Lai [20] proposed a novel heart rate monitoring method for heavy exercise. There were four sets of algorithms as the building blocks of the proposed method: preprocessing, signal representation using short-time Fourier transform, detection and ranking of potential cardiac and motion components, and robust heart rate estimation. Meanwhile, a new method called TROIKA was presented by Zhang et al. [21,22]. The method can estimate heart rate from WPPG signal for scenarios where motion artifacts are strong. It was based on single measurement vector (SMV) model and spectral peak tracking. Firstly, the algorithm utilized signal decomposition and SVM model to remove the strong motion artifacts in the WPPG signal. Then the spectral peaks corresponding to heart rate can be determined by spectral peak tracking. As a sequel to this study, Zhang proposed the variant of TROIKA framework, which was named JOSS [23]. It was based on a multiple measurement vector (MMV) model, spectrum subtraction, and spectral peak tracking. It further improves the previous results by jointly exploiting the spectral structures of WPPG signal and the accelerometer signals. Motivated by the aforementioned model, Xiong et al. [24] presented an approach, denoted by MC-SMD. In MC-SMD, a spectral matrix is constructed by using multi-channel WPPG sensor signals and simultaneous acceleration signals. The spectral matrix is divided into two matrixes—i.e., motion artifacts matrix and real PPG sensor signals matrix. At last, heart rate estimates are output by the proposed spectral peak tracking method. Tautan et al. [25] proposed a heart rate measurement algorithm using duel color PPG. There were six signals in the algorithm: PPGi, the five reference signals Ax,y,z,M and PPGref. Then the algorithm comprised three stages: preprocessing, reference and threshold selection, and wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. However, the main drawbacks of the above means are that the spectral peak tracking procedure involves many user-tuning parameters. Thus, their generalization performance becomes poor, and the computational load is heavy.

In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient strategy, named Mix-SVM, which tracks subjects’ heart rate based on a mixed method composed of adaptive filter, sparse signal reconstruction model, spectrum subtraction, and SVM-based spectral analysis. Firstly, we generate a reference motion artifacts signal component by dealing with the acceleration signals by principal component analysis (PCA) prior to adaptive filtering. Then, we use adaptive filtering to reduce part of the motion artifacts. Next, we construct a sparse signal reconstruction model and utilize spectrum subtraction to further reduce motion artifacts. Finally, we use an SVM-based spectral analysis approach to solve the spectral peak tracking problem.

In this article, the materials and process of our Mix-SVM method is outlined in Section 2. The evaluation results of the simulation experiment are given in Section 3. Conclusions are drawn in the last section.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Description
The 12 data sets are introduced as part of the 2015 IEEE Signal Process Cup [26] and used by various researchers. These data all are recorded from 12 healthy Asian males ages 18 to 35. The each dataset simultaneously recorded two-channel WPPG signals, three-channel acceleration signals and single-channel ECG signal. Two pulse oximeters with green LEDs (wavelength: 515 nm) and a tri-accelerometer (the instrument can measure the space acceleration and fully reflect the kinetic property of objects) were used to gather the WPPG signals and acceleration signals, respectively. Both the pulse oximeters and the accelerometer were embedded in a wristband, which was comfortably worn. Meanwhile, the wet ECG sensors were used for acquiring the ground-truth of heart rate on the chest.

The data sets were gathered while 12 healthy male participants walked or ran on a treadmill. They first start from rest to high speed, i.e., 1–2 km/h for 30 s, 6–8 km/h for 60 s, 12–15 km/h for another 60 s. Next, the same cycle is repeated, i.e., starting at speed of 6–8 km/h for 60 s, followed by 12–15 km/h for 60 s. Finally, these subjects slow down to 1–2 km/h for 30 s.

2.2. Methodology
As mentioned earlier, our proposed method is comprised of five main stages: preprocessing, initial motion artifact reduction, sparse signal reconstruction model, spectrum subtraction, and SVM-based spectral analysis. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the developed system. The blocks used in the proposed method are introduced in the following subsection.

2.2.1. Preprocessing
Heart rate can be estimated in a time window when the simultaneous multi-channel WPPG sensor signals and acceleration signals are slide in the time window. In our experiments, the time window was set to 8 s and two successive time windows overlap by 6 s.

At the beginning of the preprocessing, the frequency of the multi-channel WPPG sensor signals and the acceleration signals are 125 Hz, their sampling frequency becomes 25 Hz by downsampling. The above process can facilitate the subsequent activity.

Generally, health adults’ heart rates vary from 0.5 Hz to 3 Hz. Therefore, the multi-channel WPPG sensor signals and the acceleration signals all are filtered with the second order Butterworth band-pass filter (0.4 Hz–4 Hz). Then, a majority of noise is removed outside the frequency band because of the above filtering procedure.

2.2.2. Initial Motion Artifacts Reduction
In this subsection, prior to further denoising processing, we apply an adaptive filter to remove a part of motion artifacts in multi-channel WPPG sensor signals. Although adaptive noise cancellation was already utilized by [27,28] to remove motion artifacts, the reference motion artifact signals were extracted from the PPG signal itself. This approach may work sufficiently for low motion artifact scenarios, but for intensive physical exercise, the reference motion artifacts signal components needed for the adaptive filter are extracted from the simultaneous acceleration signals by principle component analysis (PCA) [29]. The two substeps will be explained in the following details:

Reference Motion Artifacts Generation Using PCA: The simultaneous acceleration signals along the three axes include footprints of the motion artifact. However, the acceleration data are convoluted noisy signals composed of different periodic components themselves. If we utilize them directly as the motion artifacts reference, this will strongly hamper convergence of the adaptive filter and degrade the overall performance. Hence, we use PCA to analyze the acceleration signals, and then choose the first principal component which contains the most “information” as the reference motion artifact signal components. In this technique, each acceleration signal goes through the following steps: first, the acceleration signals are standardized; second, we calculate the correlation coefficient matrix; third, we use the Jacobian method to compute the eigenvalues of the correlation coefficient matrix; fourth, according to contribution rate, we select the important principal components; finally, we calculate the scores of these principal components and acquire the reference motion artifact signal components.

Adaptive Filter for Motion Artifacts: During this procedure, all the reference motion artifact components are used in the adaptive least mean square (LMS) filter. We continually update the weight of the filter according to the criterion of mean square error minimization. Then a part of the motion artifacts from multi-channel WPPG sensor signals can be eliminated. Suppose the observed WPPG signal
 (1) y(l)=y0(l)+m(l). 
where y0(l) is the cleansed WPPG signal and m(l) is the motion artifact signals.

Let the difference value e(l) and the weight w(l) update be expressed as follows
 (2) e(l)=y0(l)+m(l)−m′(l);m′(L)=w(l)×a(l);w(l+1)=w(l)−μ×e(l)×a(l). 
where m′(l) denotes the estimated motion artifact, a(l) is the reference motion artifact signal components described above, and μ is a parameter which determines the stability and convergence of iteration.

2.2.3. Sparse Signal Reconstruction Model
At first, the sparse spectrum of a raw PPG signal can be estimated by SVM model [21,22]. The expression of the basic model is as follows
 (3) y=Φx+v. 
where y∈RM×1 is an observed signal, x∈CN×1 is assumed to be sparse, and it is also an unknown vector, Φm,n=ej2πNmn∈CM×N(M<N) is the redundant discrete Fourier transform (DFT) basis, and v∈RM×1 is the modeling errors.

Based on SVM model, the i-th spectrum coefficient of the PPG signal is estimated si
 (4) si=|x⌢i|2,i=1,2,…,N. 
where x⌢i is the i-th element of x⌢.

Then, the MMV model [24] can use the multiple measurement vectors to estimate a solution jointly. So the objective function of the model is as follows
 (5) Y=ΦX+V. 
where Y∈RM×H is the measurement matrix, Φm,n also is the redundant DFT basis, X∈CN×H is the sparse matrix, and V∈RM×H represents model errors.

Through the above analysis, the paper proposes a sparse signal reconstruction model for further denoising, which is based on compressive sensing theory. Owing to the strong relativity between motion artifacts in multi-channel WPPG sensor signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, we can extract the sparse characteristics of rows of the spectral matrix. Hereby, we can write the procedure, i.e.,
 (6) minX12‖Y−ΦX‖F2+τ‖X‖1.2;  s.t:Y=ΦX+V. 
where ‖X‖1,2=∑i=1N(∑j=1Rxi,j2)12 constrains the row sparse of the spectral matrix. xi,j denotes the (i, j)-th entry of X. τ is a weight.

In addition, multi-channel WPPG sensor signals are contained in the measurement matrix Y. The multi-channel WPPG sensor signals have removed a part of motion artifacts via adaptive filter. In the simulation experiments, we merely adopt two WPPG sensor channel signals (namely, WPPG1, WPPG2, respectively).

It is well known that this model can utilize many proposed algorithms to attain a solution [30,31]. However, the adjacent columns of the matrix Φ always are highly coherent, so not every algorithm is suitable. In this paper, the solution of this model is estimated by utilizing the Regularized M-FOCUSS algorithm [32], the mathematical expression of the algorithm is described as follows
 (7) Wk+1=diag(ck[i]1−p2);Qk+1=Ak+1+B;Xk+1=Wk+1Qk+1. 
where ck[i]=(∑(xk(l)[i])2)12 and Ak+1=AWk+1.

The M-FOCUSS algorithm is an extension of the FOCUSS class of algorithms. It can quickly converge when the large coefficients are observed [33]. Hence, even if a high correlation matrix Φ exists, the algorithm still presents fast and reliable performance.

2.2.4. Spectrum Subtraction
Thanks to the spectral peak positions of motion artifacts in multi-channel WPPG spectra and the spectral peak positions of the acceleration spectra alignment, we can use the acceleration spectra to subtract the motion artifacts from multi-channel WPPG spectra. The operation mode of spectrum subtraction is similar to the proposed process in [23]. Here, given two WPPG spectra and three acceleration spectra.

Step 1: We need to seek the maximum value Accl of spectral coefficients in acceleration spectra for each frequency bin fl(l=1,2,…,N).

Step 2: At each frequency bin fl(l=1,2,…,N), the value of the spectral coefficients are subtracted Acci in two WPPG spectra. Within 0≤fl≤199, the maximum values of all coefficients are denoted pmax1, pmax2 in two WPPG spectra, respectively.

Step 3: Within 0≤fl≤199, we set to zero all spectral coefficients with values less than pmax1/5 in WPPG1 spectra, and all spectral coefficients with values less than pmax2/5 are also set to zero in WPPG2 spectra. Finally, we can yield two cleansed WPPG spectra.

Because the heart rate values are less than 180 beat per minute (BPM) in most conditions (including intense exercises), and the maximum recorded heart rate value is 230 BPM, we just analyze the WPPG spectra within 0≤fl≤199. Moreover, WPPG spectra and acceleration spectra should be normalized to have the same energy prior to spectrum subtraction method.

2.2.5. SVM-Based Spectral Analysis
After the aforementioned stages, motion artifacts are mainly removed in multi-channel WPPG sensor signals. The next step is finding the related spectral peak of heart rate.

Here, we put forward a spectral analysis approach based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach [32]. In this approach, the spectral peak tracking is regarded as a two-category classification task. In addition, we also fully consider the statistical properties of the multi-channel WPPG sensor signals. Then, the procedure of spectral analysis has two steps: spectral peak discovery and spectral peak selection.

In the different WPPG spectra, the possible peaks are found by spectral peak discovery. That is to say, an adaptive threshold κ automatically is set to
 (8) κ=ξ⋅max{|x|}. 
where x denotes the spectrum of each denoised WPPG channel, ξ is a parameter, and max{⋅} is a mathematical operation, it can extract the maximum value.

Then, a candidate spectral peak set is formed, i.e., when the frequencies of spectral peaks with coefficients larger than the threshold κ, it is included the previous proposed set.

The goal of spectral peak selection is to determine the best reliable spectral peak corresponding to heart rate from the candidate spectral peak set. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one true spectral peak in each time window. There are many different features between the true spectral peak and false spectral peaks. Researchers have investigated the statistical properties of the true peaks, so these effective features showed that [34]
(1) About 75% of spectral peaks that have the largest coefficient in their corresponding time windows are true spectral peaks.

(2) About 84% of spectral peaks that have the shortest distance from their previous true spectral peak are true spectral peaks.

(3) About 96% of true spectral peaks have the largest coefficient and shortest distance.



In conclusion, we choose two traits to quantify differences among the candidate spectral peaks. The traits are the peak coefficient ratio and peak-to-peak distance, respectively. In the current time window, the candidate spectral peak set has L candidate spectral peaks. While the l-th candidate spectral peak’s coefficient ratio is defined as
 (9) Cl=|coelcoemax|,l=1,…,L 
where coel is the peak coefficient of the l-th candidate spectral peak and coemax is the maximum peak coefficient in the candidate spectral peak set.

Also, the peak-to-peak distance of the l-th candidate spectral peak is defined as
 (10) Sl=|fl−fprev|,l=1,…,L 
where fl is the frequency of the l-th candidate spectral peak and fprev is the true estimated peak in the previous time window.

In the view of the accuracy and robustness to noise of SVM, it is often used for classification and regression problems. Meanwhile, SVM has high generalization performance due to the special properties of the decision surface. Therefore, we adopt SVM to classify true spectral peaks from false ones. In the training phase, we firstly extract the two features described above from all candidate spectral peaks. Then the true spectral peaks are labeled as “1” and the false spectral peaks are labeled as “0”. Next, the SVM trains itself with the labeled features and finds the support vectors among the features. Finally, a decision boundary is determined which is based on the support vectors.

In test phase, we first collect two features as before, and form feature vectors. Next, a trained SVM classifier is developed to examine whether they are true spectral peaks. The specific choice rules are as follows
(1) If only one spectral peak is true, and then we select the spectral peak corresponding to frequency, denoted as fHR.

(2) If the classifier output more than one true spectral peak, we select the spectral peak of the closest to fpre, its frequency is denoted as fHR.

(3) If there is no true spectral peak, we consider that SVM classifier cannot seek out reliable spectral peaks because of serious motion artifacts in the current time window. Hence, a prediction mechanism is proposed for solving the problem. The mechanism can be expressed as follows
 (11) fHR={fpre+0.02if h>0;fpre−0.02if h<0;fpreif h=0. 


where h=predict−predictpre, predict is the current predicted frequency, and predictpre is the previous predicted frequency. Here, predict and predictpre are computed by the Smoother algorithm [35]. It is operated on the frequencies of the 10 closest previously estimated heart rate values. Once fHR is determined, the current estimated heart rate BPMest can acquire via
 (12) BPMest=fHR×60. 

3. Results
3.1. Parameter Settings
We choose an adaptive LMS filter of order 25 to reduce a part of motion artifacts with an optimized μ=0.005. In a sparse signal reconstruction model, the weighting parameter τ=1. Then, we set the regularization parameter λ=10−10 in the Regularized M-FOCUSS algorithm [33], and the spectrum grid number N=1024. For the SVM-based spectral peak selection, the parameter in Equation (8) to ξ=0.7, and the smoother parameter of the Smoother algorithm [36] was set to 20.

Note that the SVM classifier is trained by using five training data and five test data from the public datasets [26]. Meanwhile, we choose all training data to appraise the performance of Mix-SVM.

3.2. Data Analysis and Statistics
To measure the performance of Mix-SVM, we adopt the average absolute error, average absolute error percentage, Bland-Altman plot, and Pearson correlation to analyze the relationship between estimates and ground-truth values. Let the ground-truth values and the estimates be BPMtrue(l), BPMest(l) in the l-th time window, respectively, and the total number of time window be W. Then, the average absolute error (AAE) was calculated as
 (13) AAE=1W∑l=1W|BPMest(l)−BPMtrue(l)|. 

In the same way, the average absolute error percentage (AAEP) was computed as
 (14) AAEP=1W∑l=1W|BPMest(l)−BPMtrue(l)|BPMtrue(l). 

The agreement between ground truth values and estimates was directly reflected by Bland-Altman plot [35]. After analyzing the limit of agreement is expressed LOA=[u−1.96σ,u+1.96σ], and u, σ denote the average difference and the standard deviation respectively. At last, Pearson correlation can examine whether ground-truth values and estimates locate in a line.

As we all know, the classification accuracy is the most important indicator for evaluating the performance of the classifier. Thus, we used the effective 10-fold cross-validation method in our experiment. In this process, the public datasets were divided into 10 subsets. Every subset was considered as the validation set, the rest of the subsets as training set, and then we obtained 10 classification models. Finally, the mean of the classification accuracy of the 10 models can be used as a measurement indicator.

3.3. Results Analysis
For direct comparison, Table 1 and Table 2 give AAE and AAEP of Mix-SVM, TROIKA [21,22], JOSS [23], and MC-SMD [24] method on all datasets, respectively. The results show that the performance of Mix-SVM was entirely superior to TROIKA over the 12 datasets. We can also observe that Mix-SVM had better nature than JOSS and MC-SMD on most of datasets. Furthermore, we compute the averages of AAE and AAEP for aforementioned four algorithms across the 12 datasets. Where Mix-SVM were 1.01 BPM and 0.72%. In TROIKA framework, AAE = 2.42 BPM and AAEP = 1.82%. In JOSS, AAE = 1.28 BPM, and AAEP = 1.01%. In MC-SMD, AAE = 1.11 BPM and AAEP = 0.80%.

Among 12 datasets, Figure 2 depicts the Bland-Altman plot, where LOA=[−3.46,3.83] BPM. In order to observe the relationship between the ground-truth heart rate values and the associated estimates, we give the scatter plot (Figure 3). Then Y=0.994X+0.957 was the fitted line, where X denotes the ground truth values of heart rate, and Y the estimated heart rate. The Pearson coefficient was 0.9972.

To get a closer look to the ability of Mix-SVM, Figure 4 presents an example of estimate of Mix-SVM on subject 8 (randomly chosen). We can find that the estimates were quite close to the ground truth values as we expected.

To show the superiority of our proposed algorithm, the estimated heart rate traces of Mix-SVM, JOSS, and MC-SMD on subject 4 (randomly chosen) is shown in Figure 5. Mix-SVM had the best performance among three methods, its estimated heart rate trace almost overlaps with the ground-truth of heart rate trace, but JOSS and MC-SMD sometimes got errors. For example, the estimates of JOSS have gravely deviated from the ground-truth of heart rate from 0 to 50 s. From 110 to 115 s, 140 to 145 s, 210 to 225 s and 265 to 270 s, the estimates of MC-SMD do not overlap with the ground-truth value. But the estimates of Mix-SVM were nearly equal to the ground-truth of heart rate. Due to the performance of our proposed method being entirely superior to TROIKA on each subject, we ignore the estimated heart rate traces of TROIKA in Figure 5.

4. Conclusions
A novel mixed approach termed Mix-SVM was developed for estimation of heart rate from multi-channel WPPG signals with various types of motion artifacts. In this approach, we used the fast denoising algorithm and reconstruction algorithm to deal with serious motion artifacts caused by users’ fast activities. Then we utilized the SVM-based method to analyze spectra. Through the simulation experiment on the 12 datasets, the results verified that the accuracy and efficacy of Mix-SVM, and the estimates of Mix-SVM were close to the ground-truth of heart rate. Furthermore, SVM can seek the optimal solution according to finite sample information. The theoretical basis of SVM determines that the final solution is the global optimal solution rather than the local minimum value. The above features ensure the good generalization ability of SVM for unknown samples. Hence, Mix-SVM may greatly improve its own generalization ability.

A prominent feature of published datasets is the near complete absence of ribosomes in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTR) although substantial ribosome density can be observed on non-coding RNAs. Here we perform ribosome profiling in cultured Drosophila and human cells and show that different features of translation are revealed depending on the nuclease and the digestion conditions used. Most importantly, we observe high abundance of ribosome protected fragments in 3′UTRs of thousands of genes without manipulation of translation termination. Affinity purification of ribosomes indicates that the 3′UTR reads originate from ribosome protected fragments. Association of ribosomes with the 3′UTR may be due to ribosome migration through the stop codon or 3′UTR mRNA binding to ribosomes on the coding sequence. This association depends primarily on the relative length of the 3′UTR and may be related to translational regulation or ribosome recycling, for which the efficiency is known to inversely correlate with 3′UTR length. Together our results indicate that ribosome profiling is highly dependent on digestion conditions and that ribosomes commonly associate with the 3′UTR, which may have a role in translational regulation.

INTRODUCTION
Translation can be subdivided into initiation, elongation and termination. In addition to the core ribosome, a number of auxiliary proteins interact with ribosomes and mRNA to assist through each phase. Initiation is usually the rate limiting step in the translation of most mRNAs after which translational elongation commences. When ribosome encounters a stop codon, the newly synthesized polypeptide is released and the ribosome subunits dissociate from mRNA. The current understanding is that the action of release factors eRF1 and eRF3 results in the release of the newly synthesized polypeptide. ABCE1 (Rli1 in yeast) then acts to release the 60S subunit of the ribosome leaving the 40S subunit with the deacylated tRNA complex bound to the mRNA (reviewed by (1,2)). The remaining ribosomal complex can then fully dissociate or engage in reinitiation. The mRNAs engaged in active translation are thought to form a loop due to interactions of polyA binding protein with initiation factors (2–4), suggesting that incomplete dissociation and recycling at the stop codon may also potentially facilitate transfer of the ribosome back to the 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTRs) for additional rounds of translation. Apart from a few exceptions, ribosomes have not been observed on 3′UTRs in large quantities. It was recently described that yeast mutant, where translation termination was modified, displayed high levels of ribosomes in the 3′UTRs (5). 80S ribosomes have also been observed on large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) (6,7). One further situation where ribosomes have been observed in 3′UTR is stop codon read-through (8).

Ribosome profiling using high-throughput sequencing is an increasingly popular method for monitoring translational events and it has provided major insights into translational control in bacterial, yeast, zebrafish, fruit fly and mammalian cells (8–12). In this assay, ribosome binding protects mRNA from cleavage by nucleases generating a collection of sequence fragments (13). These can be separated based on their characteristic size (∼30 nt) and sequenced to gain information on the exact positions of ribosomes (ribosome protected footprints, RPFs) on mRNAs using high-throughput sequencing (12). Combining this information with mRNA sequencing may additionally provide an estimate of the translational efficacy for each gene, especially when properly correcting the ribosomal footprint counts for mRNA expression levels (14). Despite the elegance of the ribosome profiling method, interpretation of the sequencing read counts is not without potential problems (15). Although it is possible to separate polysomes from monosomes this may not be sufficient to separate RPFs of ribosomes that are actively translating from those which are not translating, as not all 80S ribosomes are actively engaged in translation (6,16). Comparisons of the ribosome density before and after putative stop codons were needed as an additional measure to identify regions with are translated (6).

It has not been assessed, how nuclease choice affects ribosomal profiling. It is possible that nuclease accessibility to the ribosomes may vary at different phases of translation when ribosomes are bound by a variety of initiation, elongation or termination factors. Apart from two studies (8,17), RNase I digestion has been exclusively used in eukaryotic ribosome profiling. An alternative digestion method uses micrococcal nuclease (MN) (13), which has been used primarily with bacterial ribosome profiling as RNase I binds bacterial ribosomes (18). Here we directly compare RNase I and MN digestions in cultured Drosophila and human cells. Although the data is largely concordant, the two digestion methods yield different quantities of RPF reads from specific sets of genes. RNase I digestion produces more RPFs from translation initiation sites. More strikingly, MN digestion yields high abundance of reads on the 3′UTRs. Repeating ribosome profiling under different digestion conditions indicated that the RPFs on 3′UTRs are more sensitive to digestion under typically used conditions. The 3′UTR RPFs were also found when ribosome profiling was performed after affinity purification of ribosomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, lysate preparation and nuclease digestion
Kc167, U2OS and HeLa cells were cultured in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described (19). For ribosome profiling cells were grown to ∼70% confluence and four 75 cm2 flasks of U2OS cells and 15 ml of Kc167 cells were used. Both cells were stimulated with 10% extra FBS for 1 h followed by 250-μM cycloheximide for 10 min. Cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate buffered saline and lysed in 1-ml of our ‘standard’ polysome extraction/lysis buffer (1% deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 10-mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 350-mM KCl, 5-mM MgCl2, 5-mM CaCl2, 250-μM cycloheximide, 1x protease inhibitors (Sigma, P8340) and 2-μl RiboLock RNase inhibitor (ThermoFisher)). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 16000 g and supernatant (leaving lowest ∼25% behind) was used for ribosome profiling. For Drosophila embryo nuclease digestions 0–4 h old yw embryos were collected and lysed in polysome extraction buffer using a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies). The major differences in our conditions compared to others using MN with eukaryotic cells (8) is that we stimulate translation with additional serum, use higher salt concentration (350-mM KCl) and 0.5-M sucrose cushion (20) and include deoxycholate in lysis buffer.

The lysate samples were split into two different digestion samples and digested with either 200 U of Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP)-RNase I (New England BioLabs) or 100 U of MN (ThermoFisher) by incubating for 40 min (U2OS) or 60 min (Kc167) at RT with slow mixing. Two unitsof DNase I (ThermoFisher) was also added to each U2OS sample at the start of digestion. MN reaction was stopped by the addition of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to 10 mM final concentration.

For comparisons of digestion conditions U2OS and HeLa cells were treated with FBS and cycloheximide as before and lysed with 0.7 ml of modified lysis buffer as follows: Control samples (standard buffer), low NaCl sample (100-mM NaCl, no KCl), low KCl sample (100-mM KCl), TritonX-100 sample (0.5% TritonX-100, no deoxycholate or NP40), high MN sample (standard buffer)). In addition a sample without FBS pre-treatment was made using control polysome extraction buffer. After lysis samples were processed as before, with the exception of high MN samples, which was digested with 600 U of MN for 2.5 h followed by 20-mM EGTA treatment.

In addition, a set of U2OS samples was prepared, where cycloheximide was omitted or digestion was performed in the presence of excess mouse RNA. Total RNA from mouse liver was isolated using trizol. Ten times excess mouse RNA (as measured by A260) was added to U2OS ribosome profiling sample after cell lysis, but before digestion. The digestion for all of the samples was made using our standard conditions and MN.

Isolating of the ribosome footprints
The digested samples were centrifuged at 6000 g for 5 min to pellet insoluble material. The ribosomes were separated by sucrose step centrifugation using 0.5 M sucrose in polysome extraction buffer supplied with SUPERase-In (1/500) (Ambion). A 0.35 ml lysate was layered on top of 0.2-ml sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 45 min (55 000 rpm using TLA 120.1 rotor). Supernatant was removed and pellet was suspended in 600 μl Qiazol reagent (Qiagen). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 70°C with mixing to dissolve the pellet after which 200 μl of chloroform was added, the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 12 000 g at 4°C. RNA was precipitated in the presence of Pink Co-precipitant (Bioline) at −80°C o/n. RNA was washed and suspended in 20 μl of sterile water and mixed with 80 μl 2x Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE)-urea sample buffer (without Xylene Cyanol FF). Samples were run on a 15% TBE-urea gel, the gel was stained using 1x SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) and roughly 25–35 nt sized RNA was cut out of the gel with the help of 28 and 35 nt oligoribonucleotide size markers. The gel pieces were disrupted and RNA was eluted with 300-mM Sodium Acetate (pH 5.0), 1-mM EDTA and SUPERase-In for 30 min at 65°C. RNA was precipitated, centrifuged and washed with 80% ethanol and then suspended in 5 μl of sterile water. RNA yields were quantified with SYBR Gold using Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). All samples had over 1-pmol/μl RNA.

Ribosome affinity purification
Drosophila RpS8, RpL13 and RpL22 open reading frames (ORFs) (21) were transferred to an expression vector containing OpIE2 promoter and which adds O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (AGT)-2xprotein G tag to the C terminus of the ORF. The plasmids were transfected into Kc167 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega) and stable cell lines obtained by selection on 250-μg/ml zeocin for three weeks. The incorporation of the tagged ribosomal proteins to the ribosomal fraction was checked by separating the crude ribosomal fraction using sucrose cushion as described above followed by western blotting with infrared dye conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, which detects the protein G part of the epitope tag. For ribosome profiling, 30 ml of each culture were lysed and digested as before with MN (200 U). Digestion was stopped with EGTA and 350 μl goat anti-rabbit IgG magnetic bead suspension (New England BioLabs) together with SUPERase-In (1/500) were added to the lysates and incubated o/n at 4°C with gentle mixing. The beads were collected and washed 3× with the lysis buffer. RNA was extracted from the beads using 500-μl Qiazol reagent and the ribosome profiling was continued as before.

Library generation and sequencing
Five to fifteen picomoles of each RNA sample was used for phosphatase and polyA tailing reaction by mixing 3.25 μl of RNA with the following: 0.5 μl 10x polyA buffer (0.5-M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5-M NaCl, 100-mM MgCl2, 50-mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1-mg/ml BSA), 0.25-μl Yeast polyA polymerase (600-U/μl, Affymetrix), 0.5 μl of 10-mM ATP, 0.3-μl (3 U) T4 polynucleotide kinase (ThermoFisher), 0.2-μl SUPERase-In. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Note that RNase I digestion results in cyclic 2′3′-phosphate, which will be resolved by the inherent phosphatase activity of the T4 polynucleotide kinase. Four microliter of each sample was mixed with 1 μl of 10-μM abasic-oligo dT primers containing random 8-nt sequence used for absolute molecular counting (19,22,23), incubated at 72°C for 3 min and put on ice. Reverse transcription was started by adding the following to the samples: 5.25-μl H2O, 3-μl 5x RT-buffer (ThermoFisher), 0.75 μl of 10-mM dNTP, 0.25-μl SUPERase-In and 0.4-μl Maxima Reverse transcriptase (75-U, ThermoFisher). Samples were incubated at 50°C for 1 h, heat inactivated at 85°C for 6 min after which 0.5-μl RNase H (ThermoFisher) was added and samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Reverse transcription products were purified on 10% TBE-urea gel and cDNA was eluted into 700 μl of DNA gel elution buffer (1x TE + 300-mM NaCl) by incubating o/n at 4°C with mixing on Eppendorf Thermomixer. cDNA was precipitated as before, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16 000 g, pellets were washed and cDNA was suspended into 5 μl of circularization mix (0.5-μl CircLigase buffer (10x), 0.25 μl of 50-mM MnCl2, 0.25-μl CircLigase II (Epicentre), 1 μl of 5 M betaine, 3-μl sterile water). Samples were incubated o/n at 60°C and heat-inactivate for 10 min at 80°C. cDNA was linearized by adding 3 μl of relinearization supplement (50-mM KCl, 1-mM DTT) followed by 0.7-μl (7 U) APE1 (New England Biolabs). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Libraries were then amplified using 18 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Solexa-primer-F and R and Phusion DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher). PCR products were separated on agarose gel, eluted using Qiagen MinElute Gel extraction kit and quantified with Quant-it PicoGreen DNA dye (LifeTechnologies) using Qubit fluorometer (LifeTechnologies). Samples were sequenced using Illumina GAiix and HiSeq using single end sequencing with 50-bp read length at the GenePool sequencing facility (University of Edinburgh).

Proteomic analysis and nuclease ribosome interactions
Cell culture samples for mass spectroscopy were collected, digested and centrifuged through sucrose cushion as for ribosome profiling. The crude ribosomal pellet was washed with sterile water and suspended in to 10-mM Tris–HCl, 150-mM NaCl, 1-mM EDTA using a Precellys homogenizer. Sample proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and analysed in five separate samples using Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher). The relative protein quantification was done using exponentially modified protein abundance index scoring (emPAI) (24) obtained from Mascot database search engine. Western blot validations of proteomics data were done from U2OS cells collected as for ribosome profiling, but digested with indicated amounts of nucleases. Western blots are from ribosomal pellets following sucrose cushion centrifugation.

For nuclease ribosome interaction studies U2OS cells were collected, digested and centrifuged through sucrose cushion as for ribosome profiling. Ribosomal pellet was suspended in to polysome extraction buffer using sonication. The presence of indicated proteins was detected using western blot. RNase I was a fusion with MBP and 8 μg of MBP was added to digestions as a control.

The following antibodies were used: anti-MBP (New England BioLabs, E8032S), anti-GAPDH (CST, #5174), anti-MN (Acris Antibodies, AP21415AF-N), anti-RpS6 (CST, #2317), anti-RpS3 (CST, #9538), anti-RpL13a (CST, #2765), anti-RpL9 (Abcam, ab50384) and anti-RpS7 (Abcam, ab57637). Antibodies were detected as in (19).

Polysome analysis
Sucrose gradient analysis was performed using HeLa cells as a source of human ribosomes. Cells were treated with FBS and collected as for ribosome profiling, but using polysome extraction buffer with 1% Triton X-100 instead of NP40 as NP40 causes significant background. Cell lysate was divided into equal portions for different digestions. Control samples were treated with 30-U/ml SUPERase-In instead of nucleases. 10-ml sucrose density gradients (10–50% w/v) were prepared in buffer containing 20-mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 140-mM KCl, 5-mM MgCl2, 30-U/ml SUPERase-In. Samples were centrifuged 2 h, 38 000 rpm, at 4°C using SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) and gradients were analysed using an TELEDYNE Isco gradient fractionation system and PeakTrak software with continuous A254 monitoring.

Bioinformatic analysis
The sequencing reads were assigned for each sample using their respective barcode and mapped to human and Drosophila transcriptome (ENSEMBL version 73) by using the cDNA sequences encoding for the longest open reading frame for each gene as a reference sequence. Mapping was done using the program Bowtie. Custom shell scripts and R was used for further analysis. Briefly, short reads (<20 nt) and sequences containing 16 or more successive A nucleotides were removed from analysis. Reads mapping to non-coding RNAs were first removed and remaining reads were then mapped against the coding cDNAs. Only reads mapping uniquely to the coding cDNAs were accepted for analysis. We used 3′UTR annotations as such without extending them, although this may result in cases where ribosomes that overlap with polyA sequences are missed (e.g. Figure 4d). Unique reads were identified by collapsing duplicate reads with same molecular barcode (19,22,23). Ribosome profiling data was compared to U2OS cell proteomes (25,26) by mapping the protein IDs to ENSG IDs. Ribosomal profiling counts were normalized to reads per kilobase of cDNA for this analysis. For comparison of data from Drosophila S2 cells treated with MN (8), deposited sequences from sucrose cushion isolated ribosomes from S2 cells lysed in buffer containing 150-mM Na+, 5-mM Mg2+ were downloaded from NCBI short read archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra, accession number SRX327694, run SRR942878). These sequences were mapped after trimming the adapter sequence and analysed as Drosophila Kc167 samples.

Figure 1. RNase I enriches short nuclear genes in comparison to MN. (a) Correlation of ribosome protected footprint (RPF) counts between the two digestion methods in Kc167 cells. (b) Correlation of RPF counts between the two digestion methods in U2OS cells. (c) Correlation between MN digested U2OS RPF counts (normalized to cDNA length) and U2OS protein levels (26). (d) Correlation between RNase I digested U2OS RPF counts and U2OS protein levels. (e) Gene ontology (GO) analysis of all the genes ranked by their enrichment with RNase I in comparison to MN. Only two GO terms, translation and electron transport chain, were enriched in both cell lines. (f) Analysis of individual genes related to the GO term ‘electron transport chain’. Nuclear encoded mRNAs translated by cytosolic ribosomes show enrichment with RNase I digestion, but mitochondrial mRNAs translated by mitochondrial ribosomes enrich with MN. Histograms of the enrichment distribution of all genes are shown on the background to highlight the levels of enrichment. (g) P-value correlation between GO terms enriched with RNase I and GO terms enriched based on gene length in U2OS cells. Longest coding transcripts of all human genes were used to analyse for enrichment in shorter genes. The two outlier GO terms related to ‘response to bacteria’ response were omitted from the calculation of Pearson correlation (R2). (h) Comparison of cDNA length (sliding window of 50 genes) with RNase I enrichment in both Kc167 and U2OS cells. Pearson correlation value (R2) is indicated in panels (a–dand g). All GO term analyses were done based on all RPFs on cDNA.

Figure 2. MN digestion results in high abundance of shorter RPFs on 3′UTRs. (a) RPF counts from all genes in a 1000 nucleotide region around start and stop codons in Kc167 cells. MN counts are shown in blue (above zero) and RNase I counts in red (below zero). Light blue background depicts UTRs and light brown depicts CDS. (b) Mean RPF length at each position relative to start and stop codon in Kc167 samples (top panel). MN counts are shown in blue and RNase I counts in red. Note the drop in the mean RPF length at the stop codon. 10x zoom-in is displayed at the bottom panel. The 3-nt pattern in the RPF lengths can be seen within the CDS with RNase I digestion, but this pattern is disturbed on the UTRs. (c) Relative RPF amounts on different mRNA regions with MN (left) and RNase I (right) digestions in Kc167 cells. (d) RPF length distributions on different mRNA regions with MN (left) and RNase I (right) digestion in Kc167 cells. (e) Same as (a), but data from U2OS cells. (f) Same as (b), but data from U2OS cells. (g) Same as (c), but data from U2OS cells. (h) Same as (d), but data from U2OS cells. Note that all RPF locations match to the start of the read, not the E, P or A sites of the ribosome.

Figure 3. RNase I digests small ribosomal subunit. U2OS cells were digested with MN and RNase I as for ribosome profiling and protein levels were analysed by mass spectrometry after ribosome separation using sucrose cushion centrifugation. (a) Correlation of protein abundances (log2 of emPAI scores) between the two digestions. Ribosomal proteins and Pearson correlation value (R2) are indicated. (b) Average protein abundances (normalized emPAI scores) for small subunit (RpS), large subunit (RpL) and mitochondrial (MitoRp) ribosomal proteins with MN and RNase I digestions. Relative enrichments of RpS compared to RpL proteins with RNase I and MN are indicated, suggesting differences in ribosome degradation. (c) Fraction of ribosome profiling sequencing reads mapping to 18S rRNA. S2* indicates Drosophila S2 cell sample from (8). (d) Visualization of the relative changes in RpS proteins based on the mass spec data. Upper left structure shows log2 relative abundance of RpS proteins (MN/RNase I) mapped on human 40S ribosome (PDB accessions 3J3D (18S rRNA) and 3J3A (RpS proteins)). Grey proteins were not identified by mass spectrometry. Structure on the right, shows the most MN-enriched proteins (log2 fold change > 1.5) colour coded individually. Other proteins are in light brown and rRNA is in grey. The views are from the solvent side of the 40S ribosome. Bar chart on the bottom left shows the relative enrichment of individual RpS proteins. (e) Sucrose gradient analysis of MN (left) and RNase I (right) digested HeLa cells. Undigested lysate is shown as a control. Equal amount of cell lysate was used for each sample. (f) Western blots of U2OS cell lysates digested with indicated amounts of nucleases and centrifuged through sucrose cushion. Some ribosomal proteins, like RpS3, are dissociated from ribosomes more with RNase I than with MN. See also panel (d). Nuclease digestions were carried out under same conditions as for the ribosome profiling samples.

Figure 4. RPFs on 3′UTRs originate from same positions but in different quantities. (a) Examples of Drosophila (top row) and human genes (bottom row) with abundant RPFs on 3′UTR. MN samples are in dark blue and RNase I samples in red. For colour coding, see Figure 2. Note the common locations of many large RPF peaks on CDS. (b) Detailed view of the human YWHAZ/14–3–3z gene 3′UTR from panel (a). The RNase I RPFs (light red, below zero) are plotted in 10x magnification to better visualize RPF peak locations (magnified scale in red). Stop codons and AUG codons are indicated immediately above the x-axis with red and blue ticks, respectively. Red numbers above the tick marks indicate the reading frame relative to CDS for most proximal stop codons (0 = in frame with CDS, 1 = +1 and 2 = +2 relative to reading frame). (c) Correlation of RPF counts on 3′UTRs between MN and RNase I digestions in U2OS cells. Inset displays the Pearson correlation values (R2) for RPFs on each individual cDNA region. (d) Normalized RPF density in U2OS samples along 5′UTR and 3′UTR relative to UTR lengths rather than absolute position as in Figure 2. MN data are shown in blue and RNase I data in red. Note the RPF density increase towards the start codon in the 5′UTR data, especially with RNase I, and the continuous drop in 3′UTR RPF density. The final 3′UTR density drop in the extreme 3′ end is due to mapping as we do not extend the 3′UTR sequence.

The reads on 5′UTR were defined as those whose start was located more than 12 nt upstream from AUG codon and for 3′UTR those with more than 18 nt upstream stop codon to reflect approximate positioning of ribosomes on start and stop codons (12). Data was plotted using Microsoft Excel or in R environment. For analysis of feature correlations (e.g. Figure 5b and c), we ignored genes with <100 counts. The high salt concentration used for lysis and digestion precludes reading frame analysis on the coding sequence as shown previously (8).

Figure 5. 3′UTR RPFs associate with ribosomes under multiple conditions. (a) RPF counts of all genes in a 1000 nucleotide region around start and stop codons from U2OS cells digested with MN under different conditions (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section for details). Control conditions, which were also used for HeLa cells, are the same as in Figure 2. (b) Quantification of relative RPF amounts on different mRNA regions for the samples shown in panel (a). The dotted line illustrates the mean 3′UTR RPF abundance in control samples. (c) Western blots of Kc167 cells transfected with tagged ribosomal proteins. Cells were lysed and centrifuged through sucrose cushion to compare the accumulation of the tagged ribosomal protein in different fractions. L = lysate, S = supernatant, P = pellet (ribosomal fraction). (d) RPF counts of all genes from immunoprecipitated (IP) ribosomal proteins of Kc167 cells digested with MN. The visualization is as in panel (a). (e) Mean RPF lengths for each position relative to start and stop codon for all genes in immunoprecipitated Kc167 samples. RpL13 and RpS8 samples are in blue and red, respectively. Note the drop in mean RPF length at the stop codon. (f) Relative RPF amounts on different mRNA regions after ribosome immunoprecipitation of Kc167 cells.

For metagene analysis, RPF counts were summed for each position (e.g. Figure 2) or relative positions along UTRs were calculated by dividing the sequence position relative to start (in the case of 5′UTR reads) and stop (in the case of 3′UTR reads) with UTR length (e.g. Figure 4d). The footprint counts at each relative positiion in RNase I and MN samples were normalized to total read counts in UTR to simplify comparison between nucleases in Figure 4d.

Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using KEGG pathway enrichment function within STRING database (27) and by using GOrilla software, which analyses enrichment from a ranked list of genes (28). GC content was analysed for the complete sequences obtained from ENSEMBL. For the analysis of local GC content, sequences of RPF length starting from the first RPF position were retrieved along with identical length sequence immediately upstream and downstream of the RPF and plotted as a boxplot in R. Motif analysis was performed with meme (29) (version 4.4.0) using a second order background model generated from human 3′UTR sequences containing 17-nt CDS flank and using the following options -mod zoops -nmotifs 6 -minw 6 -maxw 10 -evt 0.01 to analyse a 30-nt sequence from all 3′UTR peak positions with more than 30 reads and which came from the Top100 genes with most reads on 3′UTR in U2OS samples treated with MN. The same Top100 genes were also used to identify known RNA binding motifs and predicted miRNA binding sites (30,31). Background was estimated using five randomly generated sequence sets of the same size and with same nucleotide frequencies. Individual RNA binding motifs and miRNA binding sites were considered to be enriched if the 3′UTR dataset had more sites than the mean and three standard deviations in the random sets.

Ribosomal protein mapping to ribosome structure
40S human ribosome structure (PDB accessions 3J3D (18S rRNA) and 3J3A (RpS proteins) (32)) were downloaded and visualized with MacPyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Log2 fold change of enrichment of RpS proteins was calculated based on mass spectrometry data and assigned with colour-coding. Surface representations were used for proteins.

Statistical analysis
The GC content of RPFs on 3′UTR was compared to the GC content to those of 30-nt sequences immediately before and after the footprint for all footprints identified on 3′UTRs. Statistical signficance was analysed by ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test using aov and TukeyHSD functions in R environment.

RESULTS
Comparative analysis of ribosome profiling with RNase I and MN
We performed ribosome profiling in Drosophila embryonic Kc167 cells and human U2OS osteosarcoma cells using RNase I and MN digestions under conditions aimed to minimize any other effects than those due to nuclease choice. We stimulated translation with additional 10% FBS for 1 h before lysis and the samples for RNase I and MN digestions were derived from the same cell lysates and same digestion conditions were used for both nucleases. We used the original polyA tailing protocol as this was shown to be superior to the ligation-based approach in terms of evenness of RPF coverage (12). We also included random oligonucleotide sequences in adapter primers to allow absolute molecule counting in order to reduce PCR-based bias. Finally, we did not attempt ribosomal RNA (rRNA) removal during sample preparation and used high salt digestion conditions to minimize weak ionic protein–mRNA interactions, which could lead to false positive footprints derived from other RNA binding proteins (RBPs).

Library generation from U2OS cells was robust. However, we experienced some difficulties in preparing high-coverage ribosome profiling samples from Drosophila cells as these libraries had high levels of rRNA contamination. This could be traced to the peculiarities in the Drosophila ribosome structure. Unlike in other common eukaryotes, the Drosophila 5.8S rRNA subunit is formed from two separate rRNAs, the 2S and the mature 5.8S rRNA (33). Comparison of the RNA digestion patterns from Kc167 cells using PAGE indicated a prominent band of 30 nt in both MN and RNase I digested samples, which we identified as 2S rRNA (Supplementary Figure S1a). MN digestion did not yield any other major bands, which could interfere with footprint analysis. Two additional distinct bands were visible in RNase I treated Kc167 samples. These nuclease digestion patterns were highly reproducible and typical for Drosophila RNA as digestion of 0–4 h old Drosophila embryos resulted in an identical pattern (Supplementary Figure S1a). Thus MN digestion is better suited for Drosophila ribosome profiling as also noted previously (8), but nevertheless Drosophila samples suffer from high 2S rRNA contamination as the 30-nt long 2S rRNA co-migrates with the RPFs.

Comparison of the total RPF counts on cDNA of each gene for MN and RNase I-digested samples displayed Pearson correlations of R2 = 0.87 and R2 = 0.93 in Drosophila and human cells, respectively (Figure 1a and b; all data in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Although the overall correlations were similar in both cell types, the reproducibility of ribosome profiling has been shown to be much better even between biological replicates (up to R2 = 0.998 in (8)), and we also routinely obtain R2 > 0.96 for biological replicates (Supplementary Figure S1b). This lower correlation between digestions suggests that the digestion method may influence data interpretation. Comparison of U2OS RPF counts on cDNA with protein levels from U2OS cells using two independent mass spectrometry datasets (25,26) displayed a slightly better correlation with RNase I (R2 = 0.37 – 0.43) than with MN digestion (R2 = 0.29 – 0.35) (Figure 1c and d; Supplementary Figure S1c and d). The U2OS ribosome profiling correlations with protein levels are as good as those observed in yeast (12).

Different gene sets are enriched depending on digestion method
The unexpectedly low concordance between nucleases suggests that the differences between these nucleases are non-random. We analysed if any gene sets are enriched between RNase I and MN digestion. Genes were ranked by the ratio of RPFs on cDNA between the two digestions and then analysed for gene set enrichment using GO. In both cell lines, ribosomal protein encoding genes and electron transport chain associated genes were enriched with RNase I digestion relative to MN (Figure 1e and Supplementary Figure S1e and f). No other functional groups were enriched with RNase I digestion in both organisms, while MN digestion enriched only broad GO term categories, such as ‘regulation of cellular process’ (Supplementary Figure S1g). More detailed analysis of electron transport chain genes indicated that most nuclear encoded genes, which are translated in cytosol, were enriched in RNase I samples, whereas mitochondrially translated genes displayed the opposite pattern of enrichment (Figure 1f). This data suggests that the accessibility of RNase I and MN to mRNAs protected by mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ribosomes is different.

The mRNAs encoding for ribosomal proteins and proteins of electron transport chain are highly expressed. We considered the possibility that RNase I digestion produces bias towards more abundant mRNAs. This was not the case as the distribution of reads per gene was similar and MN digestion actually resulted in slightly higher median in both organisms (Supplementary Figure S1h). In addition to being highly expressed, ribosomal protein and electron transport chain protein encoding genes are generally very short. GO term analysis of all human and Drosophila genes ranked by their length displays a strong enrichment for the same components enriched with RNase I digestion (Figure 1g and Supplementary Figure S1i). Indeed, we found that the RNase I enrichment correlated over the whole range of cDNA lengths, shorter cDNAs being the most enriched (Figure 1h). Consistent with our data, a higher translation rate of short genes has been observed with ribosome profiling using RNase I digestion (12), although we cannot exclude the possibility that MN underestimates translatability of shorter genes. Overall this data suggests that the nuclease affects the quantitative analysis of the translatability of mRNAs.

MN digestion yields high amounts of RPFs localizing to 3′UTR
To better understand the differences between the two digestion methods, we performed ‘metagene’ analysis with our ribosome profiling data. As expected, most RPFs were found in coding regions in both species and with both nucleases (Figure 2a and e; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Note that the peak positions indicate the beginning of the RPF as MN samples do not allow unambiguous detection of ribosome E, P and A sites from sequencing reads due to broader RPF length distribution (see below and (8)). The RPFs at the beginning of the coding sequences (CDS) were more prominent in RNase I digested samples and MN samples did not display the ribosomal ‘ramp’ after the start codon, as observed with RNase I (12). Unexpectedly, under the conditions used, MN digestions generated up to 20–25% of all reads in the 3′UTR in both Kc167 and U2OS cells, while RNase I sample had very low 3′UTR read counts (Figure 2c and g).

MN digested RPFs were slightly longer than RNase I digested reads in Kc167 cells, but shorter in U2OS cells (Figure 2b and f). This is most likely due to the differences in ribosomes between these species and subsequently the accessibility of nucleases to the ribosome protected mRNA. Interestingly, RPF length varied depending on the location at the cDNA. The mean RPF length at the 5′UTRs was highly variable and this variability increased with distance from the initiation codon, as the read count declined (Figure 2b and f). The RPFs at the 3′UTR were shorter than on the CDS (Figure 2b, d, f and h), and due to larger read counts the variability remained stable, except for Kc167 RNase I sample where read counts were low. RPF length distributions were broader with MN than with RNase I (Figure 2d and h) as also shown before (8). Dunn et al., who also observed 3′UTR ribosomes after MN digestion and ribosome profiling, claimed no difference in median read lengths on 5′UTRs but no data was shown for 3′UTRs (8). We thus analysed their MN-digested Drosophila S2 cell data for 3′UTR read lengths. Their S2 cell data displayed qualitatively similar changes in mean RPF lengths and length variation (Supplementary Figure S2a). The abrupt and consistent drop in the mean 3′UTR RPF length suggests that if these 3′UTR footprints indeed derive from ribosomes, they have a different composition or conformation.

A reanalysis of the GO term enrichment on UTRs and CDS between the two digestion methods revealed that translation associated mRNAs are highly enriched with RNase I digestion on CDSs in both organisms (Supplementary Figure S2b). In contrast, 5′UTRs displayed enrichment with MN digestion. The GO term enrichments on CDS were not due to digestion bias of MN based on an analysis of GC content on the coding sequence (Supplementary Figure S2c).

Analysis of possible alternative RPF sources
It is generally assumed that the reads mapping to mRNAs in ribosome profiling experiments are fragments protected by the mRNA tunnel in ribosomes (12). RBPs are abundant in 3′UTR sequences (34) and some of the 3′UTR reads could derive from RBPs. Fortunately, such interactions of sequence-specific RBPs can be identified through motif searches (35). We selected the Top100 genes with most 3′UTR reads in U2OS sample treated with MN and took all 3′UTR located positions where more than 30 reads are found, resulting in 2174 sequence positions. We searched these sequences for over-representation of motifs and identified that individual motifs are present only in a small fraction of peaks (up to 6% of the 2174 searched positions; Supplementary Figure S3a). More than 80% of the most abundant 3′UTR reads can neither be explained by known RNA binding motifs (30) or predicted microRNA (miRNA) binding sites (31) (Supplementary Figure S3b and c). Altogether, this data suggests that most 3′UTR reads are not derived from sequence motif-dependent interactions with RBPs or miRNAs.

We next performed mass spectrometry analysis from sucrose cushion-purified ribosomal extracts from U2OS cells digested with RNase I and MN in our high salt conditions. The protein levels in these samples correlated well based on comparison of semiquantitative protein abundances (R2 = 0.75; Figure 3a). Our analysis did not indicate major differences in most abundant RBPs between MN and RNase I digestions. We identified a total of 3775 proteins of which 2366 proteins were observed in both samples (Supplementary Table S3). However, most of these proteins had low abundance and ribosomal proteins constituted for more than a quarter of the total protein (Supplementary Figure S3d). Other abundant protein groups were cytoskeletal proteins, which may reflect the close interactions of cytoskeleton and microtubules with ribosomes to organize localized translation (36). Translation termination related proteins (including eRF1 (ETF1), Dom34-like PELO, eRF3b (GSPT2) and HBS1L) constituted only 0.1% of the total protein in both samples (Supplementary Figure S3b). Together with the motif analysis, these data suggest that 3′UTR RPFs do not originate from non-ribosomal proteins.

RNase I activity results in partial disintegration of 80S ribosomes
We observed that ribosomal proteins from the 40S (small) subunit (RpS proteins) were more abundant in MN sample compared to RNase I sample (Figure 3b and d). This prompted us to examine if RNase I could cleave 18S rRNA in the 40S subunit of the ribosome and lead to loss of certain RpS proteins. We re-analysed the ribosome profiling sequencing data by looking how frequently MN and RNase I cleave 18S rRNA. Under our conditions, RNase I digestion resulted in much higher percentage of reads mapping to 18S rRNA than MN digestion in both cell lines (Figure 3c), as expected based on PAGE analysis in Kc167 cells (Supplementary Figure S1a). Under the conditions used in (8), and where 3′UTR RPFs were not abundant, MN also resulted in a high level of 18S rRNA cleavage in Drosophila S2 cells. The true level of 18S rRNA cleavage may be even higher as an rRNA removal step is included in their protocol. We account the differences between MN digestion in our data and that of Dunn et al. to differences in digestion conditions. Digestion patterns in 18S rRNA indicated that while MN and RNase I shared many cleavage sites, there were also unique ones (Supplementary Figure S3e). Note that this analysis only includes cleavages which result in ∼30 nt fragments due to the size selection step in ribosome profiling protocol.

Many of the RpS proteins lost with RNase I digestion are found in the head region of the ribosome although some of these proteins have extensions that expand to other regions of the 40S ribosome (Figure 3d). RNase I was also present in the ribosome pellet fraction after sucrose cushion centrifugation suggesting that RNase I interacts more tightly with rRNA compared to MN (Supplementary Figure S3f). To confirm that RNase I digests ribosomes more than MN, we performed sucrose gradient analysis of samples digested in our high salt conditions. We observed reduced level of especially 80S ribosomes and poorly separating polysomes with RNase I, but not with MN, suggesting that ribosome structure is severely compromised after RNase I digestion (Figure 3e). Furthermore, we performed western blots of ribosomal proteins that were pulled down through the sucrose cushion after digested with different amounts of nucleases. Some ribosomal proteins, like RpL13a, were not affected by digestion while others, like RpS3, which had reduced abundance in the mass spectrometry data, were partly detached with RNase I digestion. Overall, these data indicate that RNase I digestion leads to more cleavage of rRNA and loss of RpS proteins in comparison to MN in our conditions (Figure 3f). We have not found conditions, where we could substantially reduce rRNA cleavage by RNase I. We cannot conclusively distinguish if particular ribosome complexes (for example translating versus non-translating) are more susceptible to RNase I digestion, although this could be a possible explanation for the presence of 3′UTR RPFs in MN samples.

RPFs on 3′UTR derive from same locations, but in different quantities depending on nuclease
We found thousands of genes with high 3′UTR ribosome occupancy (1600 and 3784 genes with >25% of reads mapping to cDNA in Kc167 and U2OS cells, respectively) using MN (Supplementary Figure S4a and b). A striking observation was that the locations of the larger peaks were often very similar in both MN and RNase I digestions, although quantitatively the ribosome density was variable (Figure 4a). This was especially prominent within reads on 3′UTRs where MN produced ∼10× more footprints, but nevertheless locations of the RPFs were very similar (Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure S4c). The presence of RPFs far away from the coding sequences (e.g. >1.5 kb in YWHAZ/14-3-3z) and beyond multiple in frame and out of frame stop codons suggests that most of the 3′UTR reads do not derive from stop codon read-through (Figure 4b). The RPF counts on 3′UTRs for each gene correlated well between the digestion methods, especially in U2OS cells (R2 = 0.86, Figure 4c). The lower correlation in Kc167 (R2 = 0.41, Supplementary Figure S4d) is likely due to low 3′UTR read counts in RNase I sample resulting in high noise. The similar read locations argue that both digestion methods derive most of their 3′UTR RPFs from a common source.

Analysis of the RPF densities within relative rather than absolute positions along UTRs further support a common source for the 3′UTR reads as the 3′UTR density profiles are similar with both digestions (Figure 4d). In contrast, RNase I shows increased density in 5′UTR in the vicinity of start codon, consistent with known cycloheximide effects (12,37). The 3′UTR ribosome density continuously drops forming a ramp, arguing against post-lysis interactions and instead suggesting that these are post-termination ribosomes that fall off slowly (Figure 4d, Supplementary Figure S4e).

Comparison of ribosome profiling conditions with MN digestion
According to the canonical view of translation ribosomes should not be present in the 3′UTRs. Therefore, to confirm our results, we varied the lysis and digestion conditions in U2OS cells using MN digestion to see if and how the presence of 3′UTR reads is dependent on the experimental conditions. The conditions we used before (control) replicated the previous observation of high abundance RPFs on 3′UTRs (Figure 5a and b, Supplementary Table S4). However, when using condition more similar to what others have used with MN (8,17), in other words reducing the salt condition or increasing the MN concentration, we observed a reduction in 3′UTR RPFs. This was independent on whether NaCl of KCl was used. The use of TritonX-100 as a detergent instead of NP40 and deoxycholate increased the RPFs in 3′UTRs. Correlations between the total RPF counts on cDNA matched with 3′UTR abundance (Supplementary Figure S5a). The amount of 5′UTR RPFs was not sensitive to the conditions tested. Together these data establish that ribosome profiling conditions can have a major impact on footprint quantities and can be modified to observe high abundance RPFs on the 3′UTRs.

We also tested if our FBS stimulation before sample collection affected results, but we did not observe any major changes on 3′UTR read abundance, although we observed ∼4× increase in serum responsive genes such as FOS and JUN (data not shown). In addition, 3′UTR reads were also observed in HeLa cells, although the levels were somewhat lower than in U2OS and Kc167 cells (Figure 5a and b).

Affinity purification of ribosomes confirms pervasive interactions of 80S ribosomes with 3′UTR
As the extraction of ribosomes for ribosome profiling was done using sucrose cushion centrifugation, it is possible that the RPFs originate from non-ribosomal sources. To exclude this possibility we generated Kc167 cells stably expressing tagged ribosomal proteins RpS8, RpL13 or RpL22 and immunoprecipitated ribosomes under high salt conditions to minimize footprints originating from protection by non-ribosomal proteins. Analysis of these cell lines by western blotting indicated that the tagged proteins quantitatively accumulated in the crude ribosomal fraction indicating incorporation to ribosomes (Figure 5c). Ribosome profiling of the affinity purified ribosomes displayed similar RPF distribution on mRNAs as the samples purified with sucrose cushion (Figures 2a and 5d) with a high RPF content on the 3′UTRs (Figures 2c and 5f). The RPF counts per gene correlated well between the RpL13 and RpL22 samples (R2 = 0.91) (Supplementary Table S5). Similarly to the sucrose cushion purified samples, the affinity purified RPFs also displayed clear reduction in the mean RPF length outside CDS (Figure 5e), again suggesting a change in ribosome conformation or composition. It is also noteworthy that although we performed the immunoprecipitation of ribosomes overnight, the 3′UTR reads were not depleted. This does not reflect the translational status of the ribosomes as cycloheximide apparently also arrests non-translating ribosomes on long non-coding RNAs (6). Omitting cycloheximide in U2OS cells did not result in specific loss of 3′UTR reads (Supplementary Figure S5b). The affinity purified ribosome profiling results thus match the sucrose cushion based data, suggesting that most of the 3′UTR RPFs originate from interactions with 80S ribosomes. As we see similar RPF profile by immunoprecipitation of RpS13, which is part of the 40S subunit, these results are consistent with the observations in yeast that 3′UTR RPFs originate from 80S ribosomes (5).

It has been suggested that 3′UTR could associate with ribosomes on CDS (38). As these observations cannot exclude the possibility that the 3′UTR RPFs originate from mRNA associating with ribosome surface, we added excess RNA from mouse liver to the U2OS cell lysate before digestion to compete out possible non-specific ribosome binding to mRNA. Although the absolute RPF counts mapping to human cDNA dropped significantly as did the RPFs mapping to 3′UTRs, the relative read counts on 3′UTRs remained high (Supplementary Figure S5b). Although we could identify RPFs mapping exclusively to 5′UTR, 3′UTR and CDS of mouse transcripts, the low counts precluded reliable analysis of these, but this data nevertheless indicates that some of the ribosome footprints may originate from in vitro interactions (see also (39)). However, a recent analysis of post lysis ribosome interactions with mRNA indicated that most such interactions would occur with 5′UTR, not 3′UTR (37). In summary, while we cannot exclude the possibility that at least part of the observed 3′UTR RPFs originate from interactions with ribosomes outside of the mRNA channel, this data indicates that the 3′UTRs interact with 80S ribosomes extensively.

3′UTR ribosome occupancy is mainly dependent on relative 3′UTR length
The mechanism by which ribosomes enter the 3′UTR in yeast could not be traced back to specific sequence elements (5). We set out to determine if such rules could be found in our dataset. We first analysed if the presence of 3′UTR reads would depend on stop codon. When all mRNAs were ranked by percentage of reads in their 3′UTR, no selectivity for any of the stop codons was observed using a 50-gene sliding window (Figure 6a and Supplementary Figure S6a). Thus, none of the stop codons is substantially more ‘leaky’. 3′UTR reads were not enriched at putative start and stop codons as would be expected for translating ribosomes or ribosomes attempting re-initiation (Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure S4c). No specific GO terms common for both Kc167 and U2OS cells were enriched in genes ranked by percentage of 3′UTR reads in MN samples (not shown).

Figure 6. Relative mRNA region lengths largely define ribosome occupancy on 3′UTR. (a) Presence of 3′UTR RPFs does not depend on stop codon context. Genes in U2OS MN sample were ranked by the percentage of reads on 3′UTR and percentage of each stop codon in a 50 gene sliding window was plotted. (b) Correlation of relative 3′UTR length (as compared to CDS length) with fraction of 3′UTR reads on each gene. All genes with more than 100 RPFs in U2OS MN samples were included in analysis. Pearson correlation (R2) is indicated. (c) Pearson correlations (R2) of sequence lengths (5′UTR, CDS, 3′UTR and cDNA) and relative sequence lengths (3′UTR/CDS and 3′UTR/cDNA) with the fraction of 3′UTR reads on each gene. Of all sequence length features, 3′UTR length relative to cDNA length best correlates with 3′UTR read accumulation. (d) Differences in GC content on CDSs and 3′UTRs do not explain ribosome accumulation on 3′UTRs, as the relative GC content of 3′UTR does not increase with the relative amount of RPFs on 3′UTR. (e) Local ribosome position in 5′UTR, CDS and 3′UTR depends partly on GC content. Boxplots show GC content for each identified footprint and sequences immediately before and after footprint of similar length. RPFs from both Kc167 and U2OS cells digested with RNase I and MN were analysed and plotted as indicated. All before footprint, at footprint and after footprint differences are statistically highly significant (P< 2 × 10−16, ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test). All data is derived from the MN and RNase I digested and sucrose cushion separated samples shown in Figure 2.

We next analysed correlation between percentage of 3′UTR reads and sequence length features. A strong positive correlation was found with 3′UTR length, especially when normalizing to cDNA length (R2 = 0.65; Figure 6b and c). One potential explanation for this result is that MN digestion has a strong A/T bias and this would enrich 3′UTR reads as 3′UTRs are more A/T rich than CDSs (Supplementary Figure S6b and c). If so, the relative GC content between CDS and 3′UTR of each gene should predict the relative abundance of RPFs in the 3′UTR. However, this was not the case (Figure 6d). MN can also digest double stranded nucleic acid, making RNA secondary structures a less likely explanation for the 3′UTR RPFs. Thus, the relative ribosome content on 3′UTR largely, but not exclusively, depends on relative length of 3′UTR and is not due to nuclease bias.

To broaden the analysis, we compared the local GC content of the RPFs to the sequence immediately before and after the footprint. On both CDS and UTRs, the sequences on the footprints were more GC-rich than similar sized regions upstream or downstream, especially in the MN treated samples (Figure 6e). Similar results were observed in RNase I digested samples, although to a lesser extent as lower read counts on 3′UTRs are subject to the background noise. Footprint enrichment on GC-rich regions was also found in MN treated S2 cell data by Dunn et al. (Supplementary Figure S6d) and similar observations were made in a recent re-analysis of several yeast ribosome profiling datasets (40). However, unlike this analysis which focused on CDSs, our results suggest that ribosome presence on GC-rich regions is independent of translation elongation and peptide synthesis, as similar results are seen on CDSs and UTRs. The largest changes were observed in 3′UTR of MN digested Kc167 cells, where the change in GC content corresponds to the change of three A or T nucleotides to G or C nucleotides within the RPF, which cannot be explained by the A/T cutting bias of MN. These findings suggests that the GC content of the mRNA slows down ribosomes independently of translation, assuming that when the region is covered by ribosomes for a larger amount of time (slower translation), this results in higher read counts. The increased GC content observed in the RPFs also suggests that local mRNA folding downstream of the ribosome may be less critical in determining ribosome speed than previously suggested (41).

DISCUSSION
We identify major differences in ribosome profiling data when different nucleases are used for digestion. The most prominent features are the enrichment of short genes in RNase I data and the high RPF density in 3′UTR in MN data. This suggests that RNase I and MN appear to identify different populations of ribosomes with different efficacies. Based on our results the quantitativeness of ribosome profiling should be evaluated with caution and different nuclease options and digestion conditions investigated. Overestimation of initiation by RNase I is indeed supported by the original ribosome profiling paper, where significantly improved correlations with proteome were found when ribosome densities were normalized to gene length (12). However, it is difficult to conclusively confirm this, as protein degradation rate is not taken into account in these analyses. The lesser enrichment of RPFs on start codons using MN suggests that RNase I recognizes the conformation of the ribosome on the start codon better than MN.

The other major difference between nucleases, the presence of abundant 3′UTR reads, was unexpected. We have identified conditions where MN does not over digest ribosomes and reveals high abundance of RPFs in 3′UTRs (Figures 3e and 5b). These results point out that ribosome profiling is more sensitive to sample preparation than previously appreciated. This data also suggests that specific aspects of translation can be highlighted with appropriate modifications to the method. The sensitivity to digestion conditions may explain why others have not observed the abundant 3′UTR ribosomes with MN digestion (17). Despite quantitative differences, 3′UTR RPF locations were very similar between the two digestion methods, indicating a common source for the footprints (Figure 4). The differences between nucleases were not due to nucleotide bias in digestion (Figure 6d), but we speculate that this is rather due to their physical size and/or extent of digestion (see high MN sample in Figure 5b). MN is substantially smaller than RNase I (17 versus 30 kDa, respectively) and this could affect its accessibility to the mRNA substrate. It is also known that binding of release factors induces conformational changes in ribosome (42), which could change the accessibility of nucleases to ribosomes. Further work is required to probe the conformation and composition of the ribosomes associated with 3′UTR.

We show that the 3′UTR reads are ribosome-dependent as affinity purification of ribosomes resulted in high 3′UTR RPF abundance (Figure 5d). These results, together with the mass spectrometry data and sequence motif analyses (Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S3), indicate that most of the 3′UTR RPFs originate from 80S ribosomes rather than from other sources, such as RBPs.

Ribosomes have been previously observed on 3′UTRs. Stop codon read-through was previously identified in Drosophila (8) and ribosomes can also be observed on 3′UTRs in vitro (16) and in mutant yeast cells, where termination is reduced (5). We observe 3′UTR RPFs on thousands of genes (Supplementary Figure S4a and b). The high abundance of 3′UTR RPFs also prevents reliable identification of translating ribosomes from non-translating ones in our dataset based on the relative RPF counts before and after stop codons, as has been done to show that ribosomes present on long non-coding RNAs are not translating (6) (see Figure 4b). Note also that the 3′UTR RPFs are shorter than those on CDS (Figures 2b–d, f–h and 5e) and the RPFs on 3′UTRs did not accumulate on start or stop codons (Figure 4b), as one would expect in the case of translation reinitiation or read-through. It seems most likely that the 3′UTR associated ribosomes are not translating the 3′UTR consistent with previous mass spectrometry analyses, which have been able to identify only a handful of novel small peptides deriving from annotated non-coding regions (43,44).

There are two likely explanations for the RPFs in the 3′UTRs. The 3′UTR RPFs may represent post-termination ribosomes, which are largely digested when using RNase I. This is supported by the observation that 3′UTR ribosomes are more abundant near the stop codon, forming a ribosome ‘drop-off ramp’ (Figure 4d), rather than being found in the end of the 3′UTR, as in yeast (5). Another possible explanation for the 3′UTR footprints is that the 3′UTR sequences interact with ribosomes on the CDS, as has been shown with specific mRNAs (38). Such interactions could be lost under different conditions. Whereas Eldad et al. (38) observed a decrease in association of 3′UTRs with ribosomes in higher salt concentrations, we observe that the 3′UTR RPFs appear more abundant in high salt conditions (Figure 5b), arguing against non-mRNA channel interactions. Our data cannot differentiate between these two options where ribosome footprints form from mRNA tunnel or surface interactions. Whereas further work is required to resolve the nature of 3′UTR association with ribosomes, it remains similarly possible that some of the 5′UTR footprints in ribosome profiling datasets could be due to post-lysis interactions or could involve interactions with the surface of the ribosomes.

The extensive interactions between 3′UTR sequences and ribosomes suggest a role in translational regulation. As it is commonly accepted that highly translated mRNA forms a loop through interactions between polyA binding proteins and initiation factors (3), it is possible that ribosomes may move through the 3′UTR to support recycling (45). If so, 3′UTR ribosome occupancy may vary largely between cell types, as does the importance of mRNA loop formation (3). Bringing terminated ribosomes closer to the polyA tail could enhance ribosome recycling and thus potentially translational efficiency. Consistent with this, the relative lengths of 3′UTRs explain most variation in ribosome occupancy of 3′UTRs (Figure 6c). In theory, the 3′UTR ribosomes may also be competing for binding sites or be involved in dislocation of other mRNA bound factors (41). Similarly, if the RPFs on 3′UTRs originate from interactions with ribosomes in the CDSs, it is possible that they affect ribosome elongation and mRNA folding. We have illustrated these concepts of translational regulation in Figure 7. Finally, if the ribosomes move along the 3′UTR, what is the energy source required for ribosome movement? The shape of the 3′UTR RPF density suggests that ribosomes fall off slowly after the stop codon. Thus, could it be that elongation factors, which normally provide energy for ribosome movement through guanosine-5'-triphosphate hydrolysis remain associated with the ribosomes after stop codon?

Figure 7. Potential explanations for ribosomes associated with 3′UTR. In canonical view of translation, ribosomes scan the 5′UTR, initiate translation from the AUG codon (1), and elongate along the CDS until the stop codon (UGA), where the produced polypeptide is released, ribosome disassembled and ribosome subunits detached from mRNA (2). The 3′UTR RPFs in our data can have two possible explanations. It is possible that 3′UTR sequences bind the ribosomes present in the CDS (3). This could affect ribosome migration and mRNA folding. Alternatively, although translation is typically terminated at the stop codon, 80S ribosomes could migrate to the 3′UTR (4). These 3′UTR ribosomes could detach or compete for the binding sites of other mRNA bound factors, which regulate translation. The movement of ribosomes to 3′UTR could also support ribosome recycling and initiation of a new round of translation when mRNA is in closed loop formation (5). PABP = PolyA-binding protein; eIFs = eukaryotic initiation factors.

In conclusion, ribosome profiling is surprisingly sensitive to the digestion conditions and the results obtained with the method should be interpreted with care. We have identified conditions in which abundant 3′UTR RPFs can be observed. These RPFs originate from ribosomes which migrate through the stop codon very commonly or which are located on other part of mRNA, but still interact with 3′UTR sequences. As similar results are seen in both Drosophila and human cells, is seems possible that 3′UTRs may have a yet unknown role in translational regulation in metazoans.

handsome, lavishly illustrated, book promises
answers to both qusestions.

After moving to London at the age of
nineteen, Sloane pursued early studies in

chemistry and botany. Professionally inspired
by Thomas Sydenham and philosophically
influenced by John Ray, Robert Boyle and

Joseph de Toumefort, Sloane took up medical
practice as an ideal calling that allowed him to
combine work and virtuosic diversion. Like
many early collectors, his habit began on

youthful botanizing trips; a voyage to Jamaica
saw it flourish; and growing financial security
in his middle years allowed him both to gather
more and more objects, and also increasingly
to buy up the fruits of other collectors'

industry. By 1753, his holdings included some
fifteen hundred shells, over twelve thousand
vegetables, and no less than twenty-three

thousand medals. As John Thackray points out
in his chapter, what Sloane lacked in

discrimination he more than made up for in
comprehensiveness.

Timed to coincide with the 250th

anniversary of the opening of the British
Museum, this volume is an assessment of

Sloane's collecting activities presented in some
sixteen curatorial divisions ranging from

insects to ethnographic collections. Almost
every chapter is crammed with fascinating
details: for example, that unlike Linnaeus,

Sloane arranged his botanical collections with
more than one specimen per page, thereby

reducing the possibility of rearranging pages
for the sake of reclassification; that Sloane

gathered his collection of Egyptian antiquities
inspired by a profound hostility to what his
contemporary John Woodward called a
"barbarous and uncouth" culture; that a

number of the 760 specimens in his humana
collection were clearly prepared for didactic
purposes; and, best of all, that the recipe for
Cadbury's drinking chocolate was based on
"Sir Hans Sloane's Milk Chocolate".

Particularly successful chapters are Ian

Jenkins' on Sloane's classical antiquities, John
Thackray's description of his mineral and fossil
collections, and Marjorie Caygill's analysis of
the establishment of the British Museum.

Jenkins sees Sloane amassing his collection of
classical material culture in an attempt to

explore the "microcosm". For Thackray, the

mineral and fossil collections only make sense
in the context of contemporary philosophical
debates. And Caygill sensibly wams against

the teleological temptation of crediting Sloane
with an insight into what the British Museum
would become, going on to advance a number
of speculations about what really lay behind
his "visionary" gesture.

What distinguishes these contributions from
the majority of others is the care that their

authors take to assess the meaning of Sloane's
efforts in the intellectual context of his own

time. Much of the rest of the book unfortunately
adds little to our understanding of either what
Sloane was up to or indeed of its significance
for us today, beyond a count of what of the

original specimens survive. The reasons for this
shortcoming are twofold. First, in dividing the

book along modem-day curatorial lines many of
Sloane's motivations and interests have
inevitably been obscured; for the most

extraordinary aspect of the story is precisely that
all the material was gathered by one man

motivated by what he saw as a unified rationale.
Second, almost all the authors are themselves
museum professionals, which has resulted in
many of the essays being of more curatorial
than historical value. Thus while Arthur

MacGregor is to be heartily congratulated on

producing a beautiful book, rich in painstakingly
gathered and splendidly compiled facts about
the breadth of Sloane's enterprise-many of
them new-this book advances us little in
assessing what it all actually meant.

Introduction.
An excess of nitrates causes environmental pollution in receiving water bodies and health risk for human, if contaminated water is source of drinking water. The directive 91/676/ CEE [1] aims to reduce the nitrogen pressure in Europe from agriculture sources and identifies the livestock population as one of the predominant sources of surplus of nutrients that could be released in water and air. Directive is concerned about cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry and their territorial loads, but it does not deal with fish farms. Fish farms effluents may contain pollutants affecting ecosystem water quality.

Methods.
On the basis of multivariate statistical analysis, this paper aims to establish what types of farming affect the presence of nitrates in drinking water in the province of Cuneo, Piedmont, Italy. In this regard, we have used data from official sources on nitrates in drinking water and data Arvet database, concerning the presence of intensive farming in the considered area. For model selection we have employed automatic variable selection algorithm.

Results and discussion.
We have identified fish farms as a major source of nitrogen released into the environment, while pollution from sheep and poultry has appeared negligible. We would like to emphasize the need to include in the "Nitrate Vulnerable Zones" (as defined in Directive 91/676/CEE [1]), all areas where there are intensive farming of fish with open-system type of water use. Besides, aquaculture open-system should be equipped with adequate downstream system of filtering for removing nitrates in the wastewater.

Introduction
Organic wastes are utilized in agriculture for improving the soil properties and as nutrient for growing crops [2]. Nitrogen surpluses increase levels of nitrogen compounds in surface and groundwater and become a health risk for animals [3] and humans, when polluted water is used to produce of drinking water [4]. In humans nitrate is reduced to nitrite that convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin, unable to transport oxygen [5]. The most appropriate means of controlling nitrate concentrations is the prevention of contamination [6]. Nitrate concentrations have increased in Europe in the last years and have doubled over the past 20 years. In the United Kingdom an average annual increase of 0.7 mg/l has been observed in some rivers [7]. In Denmark and the Netherlands nitrate concentrations are increasing by 0.2-1.3 mg/l per year [8]. In order to reduce excess of nitrogen, due to assessed agricultural sources and livestock farming, the Directive 91/676/CEE [1] was adopted by the European Commission. Such "Nitrates Directive" defines the "Nitrate Vulnerable Zones" as "areas draining into waters which are or could be affected by pollution and which contribute to pollution by intensive use of fertilizers or intensive livestock production". Nitrates Vulnerable Zones are areas where nitrate concentration in ground and in drinking water amount to 50 mg/l or more. In these zones the intensive use of fertilizers and the high animal densities contribute to environmental nitrate pollution, as acknowledged by European Water Framework Directive [9]. For reducing nitrate concentrations, specific and programmatic agricultural practices are adopted. To this purpose the Directive cares to report densities of some animal species farmed in Europe: cattle and dairy cattle, swine, poultry and sheep. However, the Directive does not seem to consider the potential environmental impact of fish farms, despite the fact Ling et al. [10] have shown that aquaculture is the major contributor to increasing the level of ecosystem pollution. According to Troell et al. [11], fish farms represents continuous or intermittent source of pollution. As a matter of fact, effluents may contain pollutants which have significant effects on water quality of ecosystem, especially when "flowthrough" o "open-system type" is adopted, discharging residues into water bodies surrounding [12]. Nitrogen compounds are the most widespread contaminants released by these types of breeding. Ryther and Dunstan [13] have shown that this type of pollution is a limiting factor in the growth of phytoplankton in costal and estuarine habitats and then it may lead to eutrophication. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the groundwater may be contaminated, thus having important effects on water for human consumption.

Methods
The analysis has focused on the drinking water supplied by water companies of 86 local municipalities in the province of Cuneo (44° 23' 00'' N, 7° 33' 00'' E). Data refer to 2012 and are obtained from Alpi Waters Spa website [14] and from the site www.cheacquabeviamo. it [15].

The studied area is characterized by relatively high degree of agricultural and breeding activity. Natural water is extracted from underground by about a thousand springs or wells, drilled in the mountains in the plains and starts in the ducts through tanks and reservoir. A small percentage comes from surface water. We have investigated the relationship between the content of nitrates in drinking water and the number of farms and the animal densities. These data refer to 2012 and are obtained from the Arvet dataset of the local Veterinary Service (ASL CN1).

Statistical analysis were performed using SAS program.

Results
The quantity of nitrate in the considered municipalities ranges from a minimum of 0.6 mg/l of drinking water and a maximum of 43.9 mg/l of drinking water. The mean, median and mode are respectively 11,01 mg/l, 6,95 mg/l, 1,5 mg/l (standard deviation 10,35; Skewness 1,45; Kurtosis 1,329). Using PROC UNIVARIATE we have rejected the null hypothesis of normal distribution (Shapiro- Wilk: W = 0,815 p < 0,0001; Kolmogorov-Smirnov: D = 0,198, p < 0,0100). For this reason, we have applied the logarithmic transformation to the data and then we have accepted the hypothesis of normality for the transformed dataset (Shapiro-Wilk: W = 0,984 p = 0,3865; Kolmogorov-Smirnov: D = 0,060, p > 0,1500).

According to the literature, we have investigated the relationship between the transformed Nitrate variable and the pollution from fertilizers and livestock or industrial wastewater. For this purpose, we have performed a simple regression analysis using the elevation of the municipalities, as the use of fertilizers and the presence of the waste decrease with the increase of altitude. We have obtained the following equation:

 Nitralog=1.39340-0.00091659*altimetry from which we can conclude that the logarithm of Nitrate concentration (Nitralog) negatively depends on the altimetry (Fig. 1). The t-test are significant (p < 0.0001) for both parameters.

Fig. 1. Regression analysis: Altimetry vs Nitralog.

Then we have considered several parametric models for predicting the dependence of the Nitralog variable on different types of farm. In particular, we have considered the following independent variables: altimetry, densities of cattle, sheep, horse, pig, poultry, rabbit and the density of fish farms. For the model selection we have employed the stepwise procedure of PROC REG. Using the adjusted R-squared (= 0.6016) and the Cp method (Cp = 3.8949), we have obtained the following model:

 Nitralog=+cattle density+fish farms density+altimetry For the three independent variables the F-test are significant (F = 35.68, p < 0.0001; cattle density: p < 0.0001; fish farms density p = 0.0183; altimetry: p = 0.0002).

In the Table I we have reported estimates, their standard errors and p-values of the parameters.

Tab. I. Estimates of the parameters with standard errors and p-values.

Parameter	Estimate	Standard error	p-value	
β0	0.95882	0.09911	< 0.0001	
β1	0.00171	0.00033369	< 0.0001	
β2	2.34190	0.96341	0.0183	
β3	-0.00049899	0.00012573	0.0001	
The resulting model is given by:

 Nitralog=0.95882+0.00171*cattle density+2.34190*fish farms density-0.00049899*altimetry and explains 59% of the variability of Nitralog (= 0.5878; adjusted = 0.5727).

By means of PROC CORR we have shown in Figure 2 a positive correlation between the presence of nitrates in drinking water and density of fish farms, despite the fact that the correlation indices are not high (Pearson = 0.35854; Spearman = 0.24225).

Fig. 2. Regression analysis: Fish farms density vs Nitralog.

Discussion and conclusions
Nitrate pollution is widespread in the lowlands where livestock farms are more common than in mountain and foothill areas. About 59% of the nitrate variability is explained by the proposed model. On the basis of available data, it may be that there are other sources of nitrate pollution not included in the model (e.g. industrial and domestic effluents). However, we think that fish farms could play a role in increasing this type of pollution. As a matter of fact, large quantities of water that has not been properly filtered and has hosted a high concentration of farmed fish with protein feed, can release into to the environment a significant amount of nitrates and pollute the groundwater.

So, we believe that authorities responsible for controlling nitrates in surface and deep waters and for identifying the "Nitrate Vulnerable Zones", should also consider all areas where aquaculture is widespread. Moreover, such areas should be protected, making sure that the fisheries that adopt "open" farming method are equipped with appropriate filters for the uptake of nitrate and with systems for removing excess nutrients and fecal material before releasing the exploited water into the environment. This measure could be included as a part of good agricultural practices aimed at reducing the concentration of nitrates in water bodies of ecosystems.

Abstract. The expression of vinculin, a major com-
ponent of adhesion plaques and cell-cell junctions, is
markedly modulated in cells during growth activation,
differentiation, motility and cell transformation. The
stimulation of quiescent cells by serum factors and the
culturing of cells on highly adhesive matrices induce
vinculin gene expression, whereas the transformation
of fibroblast and epithelial cells often results in de-
creased vinculin expression (reviewed in Rodrfguez
Fermindez, J. L., B. Geiger, D. Salomon, I. Sabanay,
M. Z611er, and A. Ben-Ze'ev. 1992. J. Cell Biol.
119:427). To study the effect of reduced vinculin ex-
pression on cell behavior, 3T3 cells were transfected
with an antisense vinculin cDNA construct, and
clones displaying decreased vinculin levels down to
10-30% of control levels were isolated. These cells
showed a round phenotype with smaller and fewer
vinculin-positive plaques localized mostly at the cell
periphery. In addition, they displayed an increased
motility compared to controls, manifested by a faster
closure of "wounds" introduced into the monolayer,
and by the formation of longer phagokinetic tracks.
Moreover, the antisense transfectants acquired a higher
cloning efficiency and produced larger colonies in soft
agar than the parental counterparts. The results dem-
onstrate that the regulation of vinculin expression in
cells can affect, in a major way, cell shape and motil-
ity, and that decreased vinculin expression can induce
cellular changes reminiscent of those found in trans-
formed cells.
M
ICROFILAMENTS are major cytoskeletal compo-
nents of eukaryotic cells involved in determining
cell shape, dynamics, and adhesion. At cell junc-
tions, either with other cells, or with the extracellular matrix
(ECM),' microfilaments are linked to transmembrane re-
ceptors of the cadherin and integrin families by cytoplasmic
adherens junction (AJ) plaque proteins (Burridge et al.,
1988; Geiger and Ginsberg, 1991; Tsukita et al., 1992). Vin-
culin is a major and ubiquitous, AJ plaque component (Gei-
ger, 1979, 1989; Burridge et al., 1988), whose complete se-
quence (Cotou and Craig, 1988; Price et al., 1989) and the
protein domains involved in its interaction with other junc-
tional proteins were determined (Bendori et al., 1989; Jones
et al., 1989; Westmeyer et al., 1990).
While vinculin belongs to the group of"household" struc-
tural proteins, its expression may be modulated in a variety
of cell types in culture and in vivo. For example, cultured
fibroblasts regulate vinculin mRNA and protein synthesis in
response to changes in cell contacts and shape (Ungar et al.,
1986; Bendori et al., 1987). Vinculin organization and ex-

pression are also regulated during differentiation of a variety
of cell types including granulosa cells (Ben-Ze'ev and Am-
sterdam, 1987), adipocytes (Rodrfguez Fern~mdez and Ben-
Ze'ev, 1989), smooth muscle cells in culture (Belkin et al.,
1988), and migrating epithelial cells in vivo (Zieske et al.,
1989). In addition, vinculin organization (Ridley and Hall,
1992) and vinculin gene expression are rapidly and tran-
siently stimulated in quiescent 31"3cells after serum-factor
stimulation (Ben-Ze'ev et al., 1990; Bellas et al., 1991), and
in regenerating rat liver (Gltick et al., 1992). Moreover, the
level of vinculin is reduced or even undetectable in certain
malignant cells of fibroblastic and epithelial origin which
also have a diminished microfilarnent system (Raz et al.,
1986; Rodrfguez Fern,-tndez et al., 1992a). The molecular
basis for the regulation of vinculin expression and its rela-
tionship to the observed cellular changes are still largely elu-
sive (Ben-Ze'ev, 1991).
The possiblephysiological significance ofthe regulation of
vinculin levels was recently addressed by the overexpression
of vinculin in normal and transformed cells, followed by ex-
amination of the consequent effects on cell behavior (ROd-
rfguez Fern(mdez et al., 1992a, b). Increased vinculin ex-
pression in 31"3 cells resulted in extensive spreading with
abundance of stress fibers and adhesion plaques (Geiger et
al., 1992a), accompanied by a dramatic decrease in cell mo-

tility (Rodrfguez Fern,~ndez et al., 1992b). Elevation of vin-
culin expression in malignant fibroblastic and epithelial cells
which express diminished levels of vinculin, resulted in the
suppression of the tumorigenic ability and anchorage inde-
pendence of these cells (Rodrfguez Femfmdez et al., 1992a).
In this study, we examined the effect of a forced reduction
in vinculin levels on the structural and kinetic properties of
nontransformed cells. The level of vinculin was specifically
suppressed in 3T3 cells by antisense vinculin eDNA trans-
fection, and clones stably expressing vinculin at levels be-
tween 10-70% of those detected in 3T3 cells were isolated.
We show here that cells with low vinculin levels are poorly
spread, displaying fewer and smaller adhesion plaques. Fur-
thermore, these cells showed increased motility, and pro-
duced large colonies in soft agar. These results suggest that
decreased vinculin expression in 3T3 cells can affect cell
morphology and growth properties in a mode reminiscent of
that found in anchorage independent tumor cells.
Materials and Methods
TheAntisense Vinculin Expression VectorNIV-pJ4fl
A 1.06-kb fragment (Ben-Ze'ev et al., 1990), coding for amino acids
198-549 of mouse vinculin, was inserted in the antisense orientation into
the expression cassette of the pJ4fl expression vector (Sbaulsky et al.,
1991). In this vector, transcription of the eDNA is controlled by the
Moloney routine leukemia virus long terminal repeat pmmoter-enbancer
sequence (Mo-MuLV LTR), whereas the SV40 small t antigen intron, and
the SV40T antigenpolyadenylation sequences providesignals for RNA pro-
cessing. This mouse vineulin antisense expression vector was designated
NIV-pJ4fl (Fig. 1).
Cell Culture and Transfection
Balb/C 3"I"3clone A31 cells were grown in DME plus 10% calf serum
(Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY). The cells were cotransfected with
the NIV-pJ4fl vector and with a neomycin resistant gene (neoz) by the cal-
cium phosphate precipitation method and colonies resistant to 400 ~tg/ml
G-418 (Geneticin; Gibco Laboratories) were isolated.
Growth in semisolid medium was determined by seeding 104 cells per
35-ram diam dish in 0.85 mi of medium containing 10% serum and 0.3%
baeto-agar (Difoo, Detroit, MI) on top of a solid layer of 2.5 mi of 0.5%
bacto-agar in the same medium. Plates were incubated for 2 wk at 37C
in a 9% COz-containing humidified incubator. The number of colonies
containing >50 cells was determined microscopically.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were grown on glass coversllps, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in
PBS and permeabilizedwith0.5 % TritonX-100. V'mculinwas detected with
a broad-range monoclonal antivineulin antibody (antihuman vinculin,
SigmaImmunochemicals, St. Louis, MO) as described previously (Bendori
et al., 1989). The second antibody was rhodamine-labeledgoat antimouse
IgG. Actin filaments were stained with FITC-phulloidin (Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO). The cells were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot mi-
croscope.
CellMotility and PhagoMneticTracks
Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes. A wound was introduced
in the monolayer by the 1 nun-thick tip of a plastic scriber. The medium
was changed, and at variouslimes after additionof fresh medium, cells were
fixed and stained with Giemsa. The number of migrating cells into a
l-ram2 area of the wound was microscopically counted in 5-13 randomly
picked areas along the wound for each cell type, as described (Rodrfguez
F e ~ et al., 1992b).
Tomeasure the phagokinetictracks, coverslips treated with a 1% solution
of BSA were coated with colloidal gold (Sigma Immunochemicals) accord-
ing to Albrecht-Bnehler (1977). One thousand cells were seeded on each
20 x 20 mm coverslip and after 24 h of incubationthe cells were fixed with
paraformaldehyde (3.7%). The tracks produced by cells were viewed by
darktield microscopy with a 5x objective. The lengthsof tracks were deter-
mined by projecting individualtracks on a screen, and measuring about 30
randomly selected tracks for each cell type. Differences between means
were tested for significance using the Dunnet test (Duunet, 1955).
PAGEand Immunoblotting
Cellsplated on 35-ramdiem culture dishes wereprocessed for immunoblot-
ting as described (l-Iarlow and Lane, 1988). Equal amounts of protein were
separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Laemmli, 1970). Pro-
teins were transferredto nitrocelluloseby electroblotting, and vinculinwas
detected on the blots with a monoclonal antivinculinantibody, followed by
anti mouse IgG coupled to an enhanced ehemiluminescent probe (ECL,
Amersham Corp., Arlington, Heights, IL). Several exposures of the blots
to x-ray films were quantitated by a laser densitometer as described
(Rodffgnez Fermindez et al., 1992a).
Two dimensional (2-D) gel electropboresis of [35S]methionine-labeled
cell lysates, using equal amounts of total radioactive proteins in each sam-
ple, was performed as previously described (Ben-Ze'ev, 1990).
Southern and Northern Blot Hybridization, and
RNAse Protection
The isolation of DNA, restriction endonuclease digestion with EcoRI, 1%
agarose gel electrophoresisand Southernblottingonto nitrocellulosemem-
brunes (Schleieher and Schuell, Inc., Keune, Nil) were performed as de-
scribed (Sambrook et al., 1989). The 32P-labelingof the probe and hybrid-
ization and washing conditions were as described (F-a3dffguezF~ez et
al., 1992a).
Total RNA was extracted by the gnanidiniumthiocyanate method (Chirg-
win et al., 1979). 20 #g oftotal RNA per lane were separatedby electropho-
resis on 1.2% agarose and 2.2 M formaldehyde gels, transferredto nitrocel-
lulose membranes, and hybridized to 32P-dCTP labeled mouse vinculin
and GPDH eDNAs.
RNAse protection was carried out as described by Gilman (1987), with
slightmodifications. The 1kb EcoRI mouse vineulineDNA fragment (Ben-
Ze'ev et al., 1990) was inserted into the BinescriptKSll plasmid (New En-
gland Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The orientationof the insert was determined
by restriction analysis. The plasmid was linearized with NaeI, and used as
template to synthesize the vinculin RNA probe by T7 RNA polymerase.
DNase I was used to digest the remaining DNA template. Detection of vin-
culin antisense RNA transcripts was obtained from total RNA samples hy-
bridized to 5 x 105 cpm of labeled probe as follows: the RNA was dis-
solved in hybridizationbuffer (80% formamide, 40 mM Pipes pH 6.4, 400
mM NaCI and 1 mM EDTA), denatured at 85C for 10rain, and hybridized
at 42C overnight. RNAase digestion buffer containing RNAase A (40
/tg/mi) and RNAase T1 (2/~g/ml) were added to degrade the unhybridized
probe at 37C for 30 rain. RNAases were inactivatedby incubating at 37C
with SDS and proteinase K. The RNA was extracted with phenol/chloro-
form and was separated by electrophoresis on 4% aerylamide gels contain-
ing 8 M urea.

Effects of Transfection with Antisense Vinculin cDNA
Construct on Vinculin Levels in 3T3 Cells
Balb/C 3T3 cells were transfected with expression vectors
designed to produce either the sense or the antisense RNA
from a partial mouse vinculin eDNA (Fig. 1), and with the
neomycin acetyl transferase gene (neo'). A total of 50
clones resistant to G418 were isolated after transfection with
the antisense vinculin construct, and 10 clones with the
sense vinculin construct. The level of vinculin in the various
clones was determined by Western blotting with a monoelo-
hal antivinculin antibody of gels loaded with equal amounts
of total cell protein. In ~20% of the clones obtained by an-
tisense vinculin transfection, the level of vinculin was re-
duced to 10-30% (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 2, 12-14, and Table D,

by transfection with the vector containing the sense vinculin
construct and clones transfected with the neor gene had the
same level of vinculin as control 3"I"3cells. The level of vin-
eulin synthesis by clones obtained after antisense transfec-
tion was determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
of equal amounts of [3sS]methionine pulse labeled proteins
(Fig. 3). This analysis suggested that the decrease in vinculin
content in the clones shown in Fig. 2 was attributable to a
decrease in the synthesis of vinculin (Fig. 3, B-E, compare
to 3, A-F). In addition, Northern blot hybridization with
vineulin eDNA showed a comparable decrease in the ,o7 kb
vinculin mRNA in antisense transfectants (Fig. 6 L compare
lanes 4 and 5 with lane 1).
Transcription of the Antisense Vinculin cDNA
Southern blot hybridization of EcoRI-digested genomic
DNA from the antisense transfected clones, using the 1-kb
vinculin eDNA probe demonstrated the presence of the
transfected vineulin eDNA fragment in the genome of these
clones in which vinculin expression was reduced. In control
neo~clones, this vinculin DNA fragment was either absent,
or reduced in size (results not shown).
Expression of the mouse vinculin antisense RNA was de-
termined by an RNAse protection assay which generated, af-
ter hybridization, a 1 kb protected fragment (Fig. 4 A) when
hybridized to a 1-kb sense RNA probe synthesized in vitro
by T7 polymerase. This 1 kb RNAse protected fragment was
present in several individual clones which were shown to
have low levels of vinculin (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1-3), but not in
a neo* control clone (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), or when hybridized
to tRNA (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). This shows that the antisense
eDNA was transcribed into a stable antisense RNA. The
presence of antisense RNA in clones with diminished vineu-
lin levels was further suggested by Northern blot analysis
showing a very abundant ,o2.1 kb vinculin RNA in these
clones (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6), but not in neo* con-
trois (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 7), or in 3T3 (Fig 4 B, lane 1).

creased vinculin expression.
This RNA apparently resulted from the transcription of the
antisense eDNA which terminated at the SV40 T polyadenyl-
ation signal (Fig. 1).
Phenotype of the Antisense Vinculin
Transfected Clones
Phase contrast microscopic analysis showed that the cells of
antisense transfected clones displaying diminished vinculin
levels were mostly round and poorly spread on the substrate
(Fig. 5, C, E, and F). In contrast, the G418-resistant control
clones (Fig. 5 D) expressing normal vinculin levels as well
as cells transfected with the sense vinculin vector, were well
spread and had a characteristic fibroblastic morphology, in-
distinguishable from that of the parental cells. This rounded
phenotype was apparent in clones expressing vinculin at a
level ,30% or lower than that of control 3T3 cells (Table I).
Clones expressing vinculin at 45 %, and more, of the level
in 3T3 cells exhibited an apparently normal morphology and
vinculin organization. Immunofluorcscence analysis of the
clones with low vinculin levels revealed a much reduced
number and smaller, vinculin-containing adhesion plaques
(Fig. 5 B), as compared to ncor control cells which display
a developed adhesion plaque system (Fig. 5 A).
It was noticed that after several weeks of passage in cul-
ture, the affected clones regained a flat morphology (Fig. 6
B) and their microfilament and adhesion plaque system ap-
parently recovered (Fig. 6, C and D). This reversion was ob-
served with essentially all the clones isolated from two inde-
pendent transfections. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis
of [35S]rnethionine-labeled cell lysates-of these revertants
showed that the total levels of vinculin in several such clones
was similar to that of 31"3cells (Fig. 6, F and H, compare
with E and G), and that vinculin RNA levels reverted from
the low level found in the affected clones (Fig. 6 I lanes 4
and 5) to the level found in 31"3cells (Fig. 6 L lanes 1-3).
The results thus reconfirm the close correlation between the
level of vinculin and the effect on the morphology of 3T3
cells.
Motility and Growth Properties ofAntisense
Vinculin-transfected Cells
Previous studies have shown that an increase in the level of
vinculin in 3T3 cells results in reduced motility (Rodriguez
Fermindez et al., 1992b). In tumor cells, vinculin overex-
pression led to a reduced ability of the cells to form colonies
in agar, and suppression in their tumorigenic capability in
experimental animals (Rodrfguez Fern~dez et ai., 1992a).
To examine the effects of decreased vinculin levels in 31"3
cells on cell motility we studied the length of phagokinetic
tracks produced by individual cells plated on colloidal gold-
coated eoverslips, and the rate at which the cells migrated
and closed a "wound" introduced in a confluent monolayer.
The results, summarized in Fig. 7, show that cells which ex-
press low levels of vinculin produce, on the average, "0 two-
fold longer phagokinetic tracks compared to those of 3"I"3
cells, or to control neo~ clones. Moreover, the ability of
such cells to migrate into an artificial wound in a monolayer
was significantlyhigher than that of control clones (Table I).
Thus, decreased vinculin levels confer increased motility on
individual cells, as well as on cells moving out into a wound
from a monolayer.
Modulation of vinculin levels in cells also had a marked
effect on the anchorage dependence of 3"1"3cells. Thus,
clones expressing low vinculin levels, showed an increased
ability to grow in suspension culture (with unusually high
cloning efficiency, see Table I), and produced larger colonies
in agar (Fig. 8, compare C and D with A and B). These prop-
erties are similar to those characteristic of transformed 3T3
cells with diminished vinculin levels (Rodrfguez Fermindez
et al., 1992a).
Discussion
The expression of antisense RNA in target cells (Izant and
Weintraub, 1984; Kim and Wold, 1985; lzant, 1989), is
widely used for reducing the expression of a large variety of
genes including those encoding cytoskeletal proteins such as
nonmuscle actin (Izant and Weintraub, 1985), a-actinin
(Schulze et al., 1989), myosin heavy chain (Knecht and
Loomis, 1987), myosin light chain (Pollenz et al., 1992),
endo B cytokeratin (Trevor et al., 1987), and glial fibrillary
acidic protein (Weinsteinet al., 1991). This method is partic-
ularly advantageous for the study of vital genes whose elimi-
nation by targeted homologous recombination could be
lethal.
In this study we have used a 1-kbantisense vinculin eDNA-
containing expression vector to transfect 3T3 cells, and
demonstrated that the level of vinculin can be reduced down

cells. 103cells were seeded on each 20 x 20 nan coverslip coated
with colloidal gold. The phagokinetic tracks produced by in-
dividual cells were visualized 24 h after cell seeding by dark,
field
microscopy. The length ofthe tracks were determined byprojecting
'~30 randomtracks for each cell line on a screen and by measuring
their length. The following cell lines were studied: 3"1"3;Cll, a
neorcontrol; A51, B51, C61 and B61, are clones with reduced lev-
els of vinculin (see Table I). Values differ significantly at p < 0.01
from the Cll control clone, and atp < 0.025 from 3"1"3according

the levels of the microfilament proteins actin, the nonmuscle
tropomyosin isoforms and ot-actinin, nor in that of the
cytoskeletai proteins ot and B tubulin, or vimentin.
The phenotypic changes obtained in antisense vinculin
transfected clones were apparently unstable, and after five to
seven passages in culture the cells re-expressed vinculin
RNA and protein at levels comparable to those of control
3T3, and regained the flat morphology. Moreover, cells
showing only a moderate decrease in vinculin expression
(<50% reduction) displayed a flat phenotype and their motile
properties were unaltered. Taken together, the results show
that the effects observed are attributable to the decrease in
vinculin expression, and further demonstrate the tight rela-
tionship between the expression of vinculin and the shape of
the cells and their adhesion plaques. Interestingly, Northern
blot analysis indicated that the revertants still produced
significant levels of RNA corresponding to the antisense
eDNA used for transfection. This phenomenon has been
reported also in other systems, including studies with cyto-
skeletal protein genes (Liu et ai., 1992; Knecht, 1989;
Knecht and Loomis, 1987; Schulze et al., 1989). The mech-
anisms responsible for reversion of antisense suppression in
those systems is still enigmatic. It was suggested that it may
involve the induction of the antagonistic effects of the unwin-
dase, or a change in the compartmentalization of the target

RNA thus making it inaccessible to the antisense RNA (for
recent reviews see Inoye, 1988; Erickson and Izant, 1992).
The changes in cell phenotype and growth properties in
agar of cells expressing low vinculin levels were not suf-
ficiently stable to allow a long term study of possible effects
on the tumorigenic ability of the cells in animals. Neverthe-
less, the poorly spread phenotype of these clones, and their
increased motility and ability to form colonies in agar, are
known characteristics of transformed fibroblasts (Stoker et
al., 1968; Shin et al., 1975). In agreement with these
findings, a dramatic decrease in vinculin expression was de-
tected in SV40-transformed 3T3 cells, and in a spontaneous
adenocarcinoma, and the restoration of vinculin to near nor-
mal levels in these transformed cells effectively suppressed
their tumorigenic ability in animals and decreased their an-
chorage independence (Rodriguez Fermindez et al., 1992a).
The present study extends these observations and demon-
strates that in normal cells a targeted reduction in vinculin
expression was sufficient for conferring changes in cell
shape, motility, and in the adhesion-dependent growth abil-
ity of the cells. The modulation of vinculin expression may
therefore constitute an effective control mechanism for sup-
pressing or allowing cell transformation.
As vinculin is a major component of adhesion plaques and
cell junctions, and is known to associate with several other
proteins which form and regulate cell adhesion, it is conceiv-
able that changes in vinculin levels exert their effectby affect-
ing signals related to cell adhesion. Studies with truncated
adhesion receptors of either the integrin or cadherin type, in
which the extracellular domains of the receptors were
deleted or modified, showed that these receptors are still
recruited to cell-cell and ceI1-ECM adhesions, provided
their cytoplasmic domain is preserved (LaFlamme et al.,
1992; Geiger et al., 1992b; Fujimori and Takeichi, 1993).
These observations suggest a role for cytoskeletal plaque
proteins in an "inside out" regulation of adhesion by control-
ling the recruitment and assembly of such receptors via their
cytoplasmic domains and their binding to microfilaments.
The mechanisms ofthis regulation are suggested to involve
posttranslational modifications, including tyrosine phos-
phorylation (Volberg et al., 1992; Burridge et al., 1992;
Juliano and Haskill, 1993; Guan and Shalloway, 1992). This
suggestion is based on the fact that vinculin and other AJ
components are substrates for tyrosine kinases which are
localized at cell junctions and adhesion plaques (Sefton et
al., 1981; Rohrschneider, 1980), and on observations indi-
cating that the activity of such M-associated kinases is
elevated in transformed cells (Guan and Shalloway, 1992).
Moreover, profound morphological and motile changes are
induced by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases in normal cells,
and the conditional morphological changes induced in ts mu-
tants for transformation by RSV are reversed by inhibiting
tyrosine kinases (Volberg et al., 1991, 1992).
The present study demonstrates that in addition to such
posttranslational modifications, changes in the expression of
plaque components may provide an alternative mechanism
for controlling adhesion-related cell functions. The coopera-
tive model for the assembly of the junctional plaque from
soluble cytoplasmic components (Kreis et al., 1984; Geiger
et al., 1990, 1992a) would predict that a decrease in vinculin
expression may result in an inefficient assembly of adhesion
plaque molecules, leading to decreased adhesion, and this in
turn will result in increased motility. In contrast, overexpres-
sion of vinculin may facilitate a cooperative and more
efficient recruitment and assembly of AJs, and will lead to
increased adhesion and decreased motility. The experimen-
tal data of this study and of several other studies, in which
either vinculin (Rodrfguez Fermtndez et al., 1992b), or other
microfilament proteins such as gelsolin (Cunningham et al.,
1991)and a-actinin (Gliick et al., 1993) were overexpressed,
are consistent with these views. For example, the increase in
vinculin expression by 20% in 3T3 cells was sufficient for
dramatically reducing cell motility (Rodrfguez Fermindez et
al., 1992b), while similar overexpression of the actin sever-
ing protein gelsolin, resulted in a significant increase in the
chemotactic migration of 3T3 cells (Cunningham et al.,
1991).
The molecular mechanisms which link the changes in-
duced in vinculin level with altered cell shape and motility,
and the associated alterations in anchorage dependence are
not defined yet. A positive correlation between cell locomo-
tion and the stimulation of cell proliferation by growth fac-
tors was suggested in both fibroblasts (Heckman et al., 1993)
and epithelial cells (Barrandon and Green, 1987). An-
chorage dependence is a characteristic property of normal
cells, while anchorage independent growth, namely the loss
of requirement for cell-ECM adhesion for growth, is consid-
ered one of the hallmarks of cell transformation (Stoker et
al., 1968; Shin et al., 1975; Ben-Ze'ev et al., 1980; Wittels-
berger et al., 1981). Several recent reports have suggested
that signals for normal cell growth are transmitted from the
ECM through integrins (reviewed by Schwartz, 1992;
Juliano and Haskill, 1993), and in transformed cells such
signaling may be constitutively activated, as manifested by
their anchorage independent growth (Guan and Shalloway,
1992; Juliano and Haskill, 1993; Ben-Ze'ev, 1992). It is pos-
sible that changes in the assembly state of the adhesion com-
plex between integrins and the microfilaments, induced by
modulating vinculin expression, may confer alterations in
the adhesion-related signal transduction, and thereby lead to
the observed anchorage independent growth of antisense-
transfected cells. Further studies, including the generation of
stable clones with vinculin null mutations are needed for
elucidating the molecular details of this link between the
regulation of AJ protein levels and the control of cell mor-
phology, motility and growth.

Here, we report that a reduction in the synaptogenic protein neuroligin-1 in adult-born neurons in vivo decreased their survival, but surprisingly, this effect was independent of changes in excitatory synaptic function. Instead, the decreased survival was associated with unexpected changes in dendrite and spine morphology during granule cell maturation, suggesting a link between cell growth and survival.

Introduction
Adult-born hippocampal granule cells are generated throughout mammalian life from stem cells residing in the hippocampal subgranular zone (Taupin and Gage, 2002). During the first 4 weeks after mitosis, newborn granule cells extend dendrites and receive synaptic input from GABAergic interneurons and excitatory afferents (Esposito et al., 2005) in a process important for learning and memory (Ming and Song, 2011). However, between weeks 1 and 4, the number of newborn granule cells decreases by about 50% as a result of apoptosis (Kempermann et al., 2003; Sierra et al., 2010), subject to an array of environmental and biological influences. For example, both active learning and environmental enrichment increase survival (Kempermann et al., 1997; Gould et al., 1999). As these conditions also increase dendritic arborization and dendritic spine formation (van Praag et al., 2000; Ambrogini et al., 2010; Tronel et al., 2010), it has been hypothesized that learning enhances the synaptic integration of newborn cells, providing a survival signal for cells that might otherwise be relegated to an apoptotic fate (Gould et al., 1999). Consistent with this idea, synaptic NMDARs are necessary for newborn granule cell survival (Tashiro et al., 2006) and activity-dependent spine formation (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999).

The synaptogenic protein neuroligin-1 has a critical role in functional excitatory synapse formation (Craig and Kang, 2007; Sudhof, 2008), and neuroligin-1 overexpression in adult-born granule cells in vivo can drive excitatory synapse formation and enhance dendritic process outgrowth (Schnell et al., 2012). Neuroligin-1 knockdown reduces excitatory synapse number in mature dentate granule cells (Shipman and Nicoll, 2012), but the role of endogenous neuroligin-1 in immature adult-born cells during their synaptic integration into the dentate gyrus is unknown. Here, we use reduce neuroligin-1 expression during the maturation of adult-born granule cells in vivo. We find that endogenous neuroligin-1 has a critical role in dictating the morphology and survival of adult born granule cells, and that these roles are independent of functional synaptogenesis.

Newborn granule cells were identified using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus-based retroviral vectors, which require mitosis for cell transduction and are used to label and manipulate adult-born granule cells (van Praag et al., 2002). GFP- and mCherry-expressing retroviruses were created using a pSie-based viral backbone, with fluorophore expression driven by a ubiquitin promoter and followed by a woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element (Luikart et al., 2011). Knockdown was achieved using two copies of a validated neuroligin-1 hairpin shRNA sequence (GGAAGGTACTGGAAATCTATTCAAGAGATAGATTTCCAGTACC TTCCTTTTTT; Chih et al., 2005; Shipman et al., 2011) separately driven by H1 and U6 promoters, as this provided the highest degree of knockdown in a separate set of experiments (B. Luikart, pers. commun.). To validate our shRNA knockdown construct, we transfected HEK cells with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged mouse neuroligin-1 together with either our retroviral shRNA plasmid or a retroviral control vector, and verified that our shRNA construct reduced neuroligin-1 mRNA levels using quantitative PCR (% knockdown = 74.9 ± 9.3%, n = 3 independent transfections). Viral particles were generated as previously described (Schnell et al., 2012).

Injection
All procedures were performed in accordance with OHSU and VA IACUC-approved protocols. Male and female C57Bl/6 mice were injected with retroviral particles at 6–8 weeks of age, and littermates were used for injections of control and knockdown viruses. Mice were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane while continuously monitored on a heated pad. After shaving the scalp, a midline skin incision was made, and skin was retracted to expose the skull. Bilateral craniotomies were made using a stereotaxic drill, and 2 μl viral concentrate was injected into each dentate gyrus (relative to bregma: x = ±1.1 mm, y = −1.1 mm, z = −2.5, −2.3 mm) using a Stoelting QSI injector driving a Hamilton syringe. The scalp was closed, lidocaine jelly applied, and animals recovered in a warm chamber before returning to their home cage. Prophylactic oral acetaminophen was administered for 2 days.

Confocal imaging
At 1–4 weeks after injection, mice were euthanized with an i.p. injection of avertin, followed by transcardiac perfusion with PBS containing 4% PFA and 4% sucrose. Brains were post-fixed overnight prior to sectioning (100 μm), and stained to enhance fluorescent protein detection (Invitrogen anti-GFP Alexa488 conjugate, 1:400; Clontech anti-mCherry 1:2000 followed by an Alexa568 secondary). Slides were coded after mounting and blindly imaged using a Zeiss LSM 780 microscope. For analysis of dendritic branching patterns, intact granule cells were imaged with a 40 × 1.2NA objective using a Z-stack to cover the entire extent of the dendritic tree. Cells were subsequently traced in three dimensions, flattened, and measured using ImageJ software. For spine quantification, 2–3 linear stretches of dendrite from the middle molecular layer were imaged for each cell using a 40 × 1.4NA objective, and manually counted off-line. Although not explicitly quantified, dendritic spine density was roughly similar for any individual cell throughout all layers of the molecular layer (inner, middle, and outer), and the middle was quantified for consistency. Sholl analyses of dendritic branching were performed using ImageJ with a Sholl plug-in (Ghosh lab), and statistical significance at each interval was determined using a Two-Way repeated measures ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Bonferroni correction. Spine head cross sectional area was determined by measuring the length and width of each spine head from a confocal image stack, and using the equation area = (length * width) * π /4, which gives an excellent approximation of the spine head cross-sectional area as previously determined (Zhao et al., 2006). Spine head areas were compared between groups by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (Prism). All images were acquired, quantified, and analyzed by an experimenter blind to experimental condition. Data was compared between groups using unpaired two-way t-tests, with data expressed as mean ± s.e.m. Each sample (each n) contributing to the mean represents the summary data from a single cell.

Cell survival assay
To study cell survival, groups of mice were injected with a 1:1 mixture of two viruses as previously described (Tashiro et al., 2006). The mCherry-expressing virus controlled for viral injection coordinates and baseline cell survival, and the GFP-expressing virus contained either a vector-only (control) or the neuroligin-1 knockdown shRNA. Each dentate received 4 μl mixed viral stock (2 μl of each virus), with 6–8 animals injected per condition for each time interval. Each virus came from a single viral preparation, keeping relative viral titers constant for each viral pair. From each animal, six 100 μm coronal slices near the injection site were stained and imaged in both red and green channels. Infected cells were counted off-line by an experimenter blind to experimental condition, and GFP+ and mCherry+ cells were counted independently without regards to colocalization. The number of GFP-expressing cells was divided by number of mCherry expressing cells for each animal, and this ratio was normalized to the average (± s.e.m.) ratio of green to red cells at 7 days for each virus pair, to control for the small differences in viral titer between the two co-injected viruses.

Electrophysiology
Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from virus-injected animals 21 days after injection (Schnell et al., 2012). Whole cell recordings were obtained from GFP-positive granule cells using combined fluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy. Cells were voltage clamped at −70 mV using an Axopatch 200B amplifier; the Cs-gluconate based internal solution contained (in mM): 100 gluconic acid, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 17.5 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, pH = 7.3 (using 50% CsOH), 290 mOsm. The external solution contained (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 25 D-glucose,and 0.01 SR95531, bubbled with 95% O2–5% CO2. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were obtained from at least 5 min of consecutive recording for each cell; mEPSCs were obtained by 5 min of consecutive recording in the presence of 1 μM TTX. Traces were acquired at 10 kHz and off-line filtered at 2 kHz prior to analysis. mEPSCs and sEPSCs were automatically detected using a template-matching algorithm (Axograph), and manually accepted/rejected by an experimenter blinded to the experimental condition. Evoked AMPA receptor and combined AMPAR and NMDAR events were recorded after stimulation of the middle molecular layer using a bipolar electrode (FHC), while holding the cell membrane voltage at −70 and +40 mV, respectively. The NMDAR component of the EPSC was quantified as the amplitude of the current recorded 60 ms after the stimulus. Paired pulse facilitation was assessed to assay presynaptic release probability (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). Two identical stimuli were delivered via the bipolar electrode with inter-stimulus intervals of 50–250 ms, and measurements were taken from an average of 10 trials for each time interval for each cell. Series resistance was measured on-line and cells were discarded if this changed by >20% during the course of the experiment. In recordings from visually identified 21-day-old granule cells, passive membrane properties did not differ between the two groups of cells (input resistance: control = 1282 ± 183 mΩ, shNL1 = 2121 ± 526 mΩ, p > 0.1; capacitance: control = 27.2 ± 1.2 pF, shNL1 = 25.5 ± 1.3 pF, p > 0.3; n = 27, 26 cells). Summary data are presented as the mean value ± s.e.m. for each parameter, with n = the number of cells per condition, and were compared using unpaired two-tailed t-tests.

Results
Neuroligin-1 knockdown reduces the formation of dendritic spines in newborn cells
Newborn granule cells were identified using retroviral vectors, which require mitosis for cell transduction and are used to label and manipulate adult-born granule cells (van Praag et al., 2002). We injected shRNA-encoding retroviral particles into adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus to reduce neuroligin-1 levels in adult-born granule cells in vivo, and used co-expressed GFP to identify and characterize cells at varying post-mitotic intervals. As expected based on its role in excitatory synaptogenesis (Chih et al., 2005), neuroligin-1 knockdown during adult-born granule cell maturation decreased dendritic spine density at 21 days post-mitosis (Figures 1A,B), without a change in average spine length (Figure 1C).

(C) Neuroligin-1 knockdown does not alter dendritic spine length (p > 0.2).

Immature granule cells are innervated by a mixture of axospinous and axodendritic (shaft) synapses, and also form multiple small, non-synaptic filopodia (Toni et al., 2007), which presumably represent precursors to synapse formation. Interestingly, measurements of dendritic spine head cross-sectional area demonstrated that the reduction in spine density was due to fewer small filopodia-like spines without a change in large, mushroom-shaped spines (Figures 2A,B; p < 0.05), the latter of which constitute a minority of spine-like structures at this stage (Zhao et al., 2006). Consistent with a preponderance of non-synaptic filopodia in immature adult-born neurons (Toni et al., 2007), we failed to find alterations in electrophysiologic assays of excitatory synapse number, strength, receptor composition, or presynaptic release probability at this stage (Figure 3).

(C) Representative evoked EPSCs from labeled granule cells demonstrated similar AMPAR-meditated and combined AMPAR/NMDAR responses at −70 and +40 mV, respectively, suggesting that 21 day-old shNL1 cells did not selectively lose NMDAR-only synapses. Artifacts truncated for clarity. Scale 20 pA, 50 ms. (D) Summary data demonstrated no change in the AMPA/NMDA ratio (control, n = 13 cells; shNL1, n = 9 cells; p > 0.5). (E,F) EPSC recordings in the absence of TTX showed no difference in sEPSC amplitude (E) or frequency (F) between groups (control, n = 9 cells; shNL1, n = 11 cells; p > 0.1). (G) Representative evoked EPSC (peak scaled to the first EPSC) demonstrate similar paired pulse facilitation between groups, suggesting no alteration in presynaptic properties. Scale 50 ms. (H) Summary data demonstrated no change in the paired pulse ratio (control, n = 10 cells; shNL1, n = 6 cells; p > 0.2 each interval).

The decrease in spine density appeared to result from a delay in the acquisition of spines, as neuroligin-1 depleted cells continued to acquire new spines over the following week. However, spine density in knockdown cells still remained less than controls at 28 days post-mitosis (control = 2.1 ± 0.1 spines/μm, n = 9; shNL1 = 1.5 ± 0.2 spines/μm, n = 8; p < 0.02). An analysis of spine morphology at this later stage demonstrated a shift toward larger spines in the control cells as would be expected during the maturation of adult-born granule cells (Toni et al., 2007; Zhao and Overstreet-Wadiche, 2008; Figure 2C). We also note that the reduction in spine density by neuroligin-1 knockdown that is no longer specifically confined to smaller filopodial spines, but is distributed across the range of spine volumes (Figure 2C).

Neuroligin-1 knockdown delays dendritic outgrowth of adult-born granule cells
Because neuroligin-1 overexpression increases the formation of dendritic branches in immature, adult-born granule cells (Schnell et al., 2012), we examined the morphology of neuroligin-1 depleted cells at 14 days post-mitosis, during a stage of active dendritic outgrowth. Neuroligin-1 knockdown decreased the number of dendritic branches and total dendritic length at this stage (Figures 4A,B; p < 0.001). The decreased branching was confined to the inner molecular layer (IML), where dendrites first come in contact with excitatory afferents (Figure 4E). In contrast, at 28 days post-mitosis, when granule cells typically have a mature dendritic arbor, adult-born neurons in both groups had similar branch numbers and total dendritic length (Figures 4C,D; p > 0.4). Likewise, at 28 days the decreased dendritic branching in the IML was no longer apparent in the neuroligin-1 knockdown group, leaving only a subtle difference at the most distal extent of the dendritic tree (Figure 4F). Thus, neuroligin-1 knockdown delayed, but did not prevent, normal dendritic outgrowth.

Neuroligin-1 knockdown reduces newborn granule cell survival
Prior studies suggest the existence of a critical period for newborn granule cell survival between 2 and 3 weeks post-mitosis (Kempermann et al., 2003; Tashiro et al., 2006), coinciding with the onset of spine formation. Thus, we investigated whether neuroligin-1 knockdown altered survival of newborn granule cells using a retroviral co-injection strategy (Tashiro et al., 2006). In control animals, we co-injected an equal mixture of two viruses containing the genes for GFP and mCherry, respectively, which allowed us to control for variability in injection site accuracy and rates of neurogenesis between animals. The ratio of GFP:mCherry expressing cells at different timepoints was normalized to the ratio at 7 days post injection, which controlled for any differences in viral load. In control animals, the absolute number of retrovirus-labeled cells decreased over time as expected, such that the number of cells at 28 dpi was 44% of the number at 7 dpi (GFP+ cells per 100 μm section: 7 dpi = 24.8 ± 3.7, 14 dpi = 19.7 ± 1.3, 21 dpi = 13.8 ± 0.9, 28 dpi = 10.8 ± 1.4; n = 5–7 animals per group). However, the ratio of GFP:mCherry labeled cells remained constant over time (Figure 5B, solid markers; p > 0.2 for each time point vs. 7 dpi), indicating a similar survival of newborn cells infected with either control virus. However, in the neuroligin-1 knockdown condition, the ratio of GFP+ cells (containing the neuroligin-1 shRNA) to mCherry+ (control) cells decreased over time (Figure 5; p < 0.005 for both 21 and 28 dpi vs. 7 dpi). Thus, the reduction in neuroligin-1 substantially decreased the survival of newborn granule cells.

Figure 5 Neuroligin-1 knockdown reduces newborn granule cell survival. (A) Representative images of dentate gyrus, containing retrovirus-labeled newborn cells from co-injection survival experiments. Equal volumes of two viruses (GFP- and mCherry-coding) were injected, and animals were perfused at varying timepoints after injection. In control animals, GFP viruses were vector controls. In shNL1 animals, GFP viruses contained an shRNA against neuroligin-1. At 7 dpi (left panels), cell somata were smaller, predominantly located at the subgranular zone with rudimentary dendrites. GFP+ and mCherry+ tracks are overlaid; cells infected with both viruses are shown in yellow. Mice analyzed at later timepoints had a decreased ratio of GFP:mCherry cells in the neuroligin-1 knockdown group. (B) Summary graph demonstrating that neuroligin-1 knockdown decreases cell survival. The ratio of GFP+ to mCherry+ cells was obtained for each animal at 7 days, and subsequent ratios were normalized to this for each group independently. The ratio of GFP+ to mCherry+ cells decreased over time for shNL1 co-injected animals (shNL1 n = 7,8,7,5 animals; ***p < 0.005 vs. 7 days) but remained unchanged for control injections (control n = 7,6,5,6 animals; p > 0.2 each vs. 7 days).

As GFP+ and mCherry+ cells were counted independently without regards to colocalization, any double-infected cells were counted in both groups. In a separate analysis of the mCherry + shNL1 condition at 7 dpi, mCherry+ cells were evaluated for co-infection with shNL1 virus. Only 7.1% ± 2.0% (n = 7 animals) of the mCherry+ cells were also GFP+ (and expressing the NL1 shRNA) at 7 dpi in this condition, leaving ~93% of mCherry cells as proper controls. However, as this small population of double-infected cells would only tend to decrease the magnitude of the observed survival difference between the groups, the effect of neuroligin-1 knockdown on survival could not have resulted from this small population of double-infected neurons.

Discussion
Neuroligin-1 involvement in granule cell morphologic development
Most analyses of the synaptogenic role of neuroligin-1 have focused on the transynaptic signaling/adhesion of neuroligin-1 with presynaptic neurexins, and on the ability of neuroligin-1 to recruit post-synaptic signaling complexes to excitatory synapses (Craig and Kang, 2007; Sudhof, 2008). However, our data suggest a more fundamental role for neuroligin-1 in dendritic branch and spine filopodium formation. Prior work has shown that neuroligin-1 stabilizes post-synaptic filopodia (Arstikaitis et al., 2011), and can even enhance filopodium formation in response to glutamate uncaging in the absence of a presynaptic contact (Kwon et al., 2012). In live imaging of Xenopus tadpoles, neuroligin-1 stabilized dendritic filopodia through interactions with extracellular neurexin proteins, and contributed to dendritic growth via a synaptotropic mechanism (Chen et al., 2010). Because filopodia are critical precursors to both spines (Ziv and Smith, 1996) and dendrites (Dailey and Smith, 1996), these data suggest a general role for neuroligin-1 in filopodial dynamics prior to both dendrite and spine formation.

Newborn granule cell survival signaling
Our most dramatic finding was that neuroligin-1 knockdown reduced neuronal survival without overt changes in synaptic function. The reduction in survival became evident between the 2nd and 3rd post-mitotic week, which precedes the majority of excitatory synaptic innervation (Esposito et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2006), but during a time window when our results indicate that neuroligin-1 is necessary for proper morphologic development.

What mechanisms could link neuroligin-1's effects on cell morphology with a role in cell survival signaling? Neuroligin-1 recruits synaptic proteins, including PSD-95 (Irie et al., 1997), to nascent synapses, which could directly organize a signaling cascade coupling spine assembly to anti-apoptotic mechanisms. For example, the Rho family GTPase Rac1, which requires PSD-95 to assemble a functional signaling complex (Choi et al., 2005), has a role in spine morphogenesis and dendrite growth (Vadodaria and Jessberger, 2013) and also promotes neuronal cell survival during adult neurogenesis (Haditsch et al., 2013).

Alternatively, neuroligin-1 might increase cell survival indirectly through its downstream effects. For example, neuroligin-1 dependent dendritic outgrowth may expose immature cells to more survival-promoting trophic factors, such as BDNF (Sairanen et al., 2005). Finally, synaptic function might have been subtly altered in ways not detected by our experiments, leading to changes in neuronal survival secondary to altered synaptic signaling (Tashiro et al., 2006). Further studies are necessary to distinguish between a survival-enhancing effect specific to neuroligin-1, from one that is mediated by proper morphologic development of immature neurons.

Functional excitatory synapse formation by newborn granule cells
Prior studies of neuroligin knockdown have reported decreases in both dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic currents in more mature preparations, both in vitro and in vivo (Chih et al., 2005; Shipman et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2012; Shipman and Nicoll, 2012). Unlike mature neurons in which excitatory synapses are predominantly located at the tips of dendritic spines, immature adult-born granule cells contain substantial numbers of axodendritic synapses in addition to axospinous synapses (Toni et al., 2007). As many dendritic protrusions from immature granule cells also lack presynaptic terminals (Toni et al., 2007), neuroligin-1 knockdown might specifically have decreased the number of immature filopodia in immature cells. As neuroligin-1 is also involved in activity-dependent filopodium formation (Kwon et al., 2012), this may point to a role for neuroligin-1 in dendritic process outgrowth prior to the establishment of a functional synapse.

Because neuroligin-1 overexpression in immature granule cells increases excitatory synaptic function at 21 days post-mitosis (Schnell et al., 2012), one might have expected a decrease following neuroligin-1 knockdown. There are several possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. First, if neuroligin-1 is preferentially involved in dendritic filopodium formation, it might function upstream of functional excitatory synapse formation onto dendritic spine synapses, yet not have a role at dendritic shaft synapses. In fact, immature granule cells have a substantial number of excitatory shaft synapses as well as many non-synaptic dendritic spine filopodia (Toni et al., 2007). In mature hippocampal granule cells, neuroligin-1 knockdown reduces dendritic spine density as well as excitatory synaptic currents (Shipman and Nicoll, 2012), which is consistent with a decrease in filopodium formation at an early stage leading to a decrease in functional excitatory synapses on dendritic spines at a later stage. Secondly, because neuroligin family members can compensate for one another (Varoqueaux et al., 2006; Budreck and Scheiffele, 2007), it is also possible that the role of neuroligin-1 in functional synapse formation (assayed electrophysiologically) is compensated by other neuroligins. In either case, the morphologic and survival phenotype appears to be more sensitive to neuroligin-1 knockdown than standard functional assays of the strength and receptor composition of excitatory synaptic innervation.

Aim: To evaluate the effects of postbleaching antioxidant application fluoridation treatment on the surface morphology and microhardness of human enamel.

Materials and methods: Ten freshly extracted human maxillary central incisors were cut at cementoenamel junction. Crown portion was sectioned into six slabs which were divided into five groups: group A – untreated controls; group B – 35% carbamide peroxide (CP); group C – 35% CP and catalase; group D – treatment with 35% CP and 5% sodium fluoride; group E – 35% CP, catalase and 5% sodium fluoride. Thirty-five percent carbamide peroxide application included two applications of 30 minutes each at a 5-day interval. After treatment, the slabs were thoroughly washed with water for 10 seconds and stored in artificial saliva at 37°C until the next treatment. Two percent sodium fluoride included application for 5 minutes. Three catalase included application for 3 minutes.

Results: After 5 days, groups B and C showed significantly decreased enamel microhardness compared to control. Group D specimens showed relatively less reduction in enamel micro-hardness than group C specimens. There is a marked increase in enamel microhardness in group E specimens.

Conclusions: Fluoride take up was comparatively enhanced after catalase application resulting in less demineralization and increased microhardness.

INTRODUCTION
Bleaching provides more conservative whitening than other modalities like microabrasion and other restorative procedures. However, high concentration peroxides have showed potential adverse effects in animal and human studies ranging from tooth sensitivity, alteration in surface morphology of enamel, reduced bond strength of resin materials to carcinogenicity.12

Agents mainly used for dental bleaching are different concentrations of carbamide or hydrogen peroxide (HP). Carbamide peroxide (CP) eventually dissociates into urea and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide ionization occurs in the presence of decomposition catalysts, enzymes and saliva producing free radicals like nascent oxygen (O)–weaker free radical), hydroxyl or perhydroxyl ions (HO2)–more potent free radical). Free radicals are deficient electrons and their neutralization process results in oxidation of the neutralizing agent. In commercially available pure aqueous form, HP is weakly acidic to extend shelf life. However, to promote the formation of perhydroxyl, HP needs to be made alkaline (pH 9.5-10.8).34 Free radicals are able to react with the electron rich regions of pigments inside the dental tissues, by diffusing through the interpris-matic substance (organic content), breaking down large pigmented molecules into smaller, less pigmented ones. Higher concentration of peroxides produces whitening results faster abundant production of free radicals. Excessive and prolonged presence of free radicals in dental tissues can lead to a continued oxidation process. Active detoxication in human body is based on three enzymes composing the basis of antioxidant defence system–superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxides, which can be found in cells where the oxidative stress is greater like the cytosol, mitochondria and peroxy-somes.5 Role of catalase is to prevent this overproduction of free radicals by inactivating the molecules responsible for their production. It accelerates transformation of HP into water and oxygen hence, acts as a neutralizing agent causing removal of residual and unwanted free radicals. Catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains, each over 500 amino acid long. It contains four porphyrin heme (iron) groups that allow the enzyme to react with HP. The optimum pH for catalase is approximately seven (6.8-7.5). Oxygen in the gaseous form is evaporated and water provides necessary hydration to the enamel surface required after bleaching. The amount of peroxide decomposed is directly proportional to the concentration of catalase. Rate of this reaction is rapid and little energy is involved as catalase accelerates the decomposition of HP by 100,000,000 fold.6 Jones and Wynne-Jones7 have proposed that the catalytic action of Fe3+ ion both in the decomposition of HP and as a mediator of coupled ‘per-oxidatic’ oxidations. The metal acts as a redox catalyst of the catalyst reaction through three reactions:

Evident microstructural changes in bleached enamel have been seen ranging from mild, moderate to severe8 and loss of calcium.910 These changes can mainly be attributed to oxidative process involved and low pH of the bleaching agent. Possible risk factors and causes of tooth sensitivity may include the patient’s inherent sensitivity, pH and concentration and frequency of active bleaching ingredient.11 Tooth sensitivity has also been attributed to penetration of HP into the pulp chamber.12 Water based formulations to prevent desiccation of dental tissues and addition of potassium fluoride and/or fluoride to various bleaching agents aids in reducing postbleaching senstivity.13

However, free radicals produced by bleaching agent interact with fluoride present in the gel and reduce enamel fluoride acquisition or retention. Therefore, this present study through Vicker’s microhardness changes and scanning electron microscop (SEM) hypotheses that cata-lase application postbleaching ensures a greater uptake of fluoride ions and results in increased microhardness.

Specimen Preparation
Thirty freshly extracted human central incisors stored in 0.1% buffered thymol solution (pH = 7) for no longer than 4 weeks after extraction were used in this study. The teeth were cleaned of gross debris and examined under magnification (20×) and 4 incisors, thereby were discarded due to stains, microcracks and/or surface defects. For the remaining 26 incisors, the roots were removed at the cementoenamel junction and the crowns were further sectioned with doublefaced diamond disks using a low-speed handpiece as shown in the figure (Figs 1A to E) to obtain 6 enamel slabs (approximately 3.5 × 2.5 mm2 in dimension) from each central incisors. A total number of 156 enamel slabs were thus, obtained (26 incisors × 6 sectioned enamel slabs = 156 enamel slabs). Five slabs (coinciding to following 5 groups–A, B, C, D and E) from each incisor were randomly designated to each group while remaining 1 enamel slab (1 slab × 26 incisors = 26) from each incisor was discarded. Therefore, a final sample size of (n = 130) was equally divided among the following five groups such that each group comprised of 26 slabs each.

Figs 1A to E Extracted incisor crowns were sectioned as per markings shown in the figure to obtain six enamel slabs (approximately 3.5 × 2.5 mm2 in dimension) from each central incisors

Experimental Groups (Table 1)
Experimental design was as follows (Table 1):

 Control group–A

 Experimental groups–B, C, D and E.

Before placing these slabs in separate prelabelled plastic vials apart from the labial enamel surface, all others were coated with dental varnish to make these surfaces impermeable. The uncoated labial enamel surface was sequentially polished by means of 400, 600, 1200 grade sandpaper. These slabs were subjected to steam sterilization to avoid bacterial contamination and thereafter, immersed and stored in deionized water at 37°C in the respective vials till the commencement of the study.

As per the treatment design stated in Table 1, agents were applied on slabs as follows:

 Regimen for 35% carbamide peroxide [(Gel form available in syringe)–Vishal Dentocare Pvt Ltd] application included two applications of 15 minutes each at a 7-day interval. After treatment the slabs were thoroughly washed with deionized water for 10 seconds and stored in artificial saliva (pH 7.0–Pure Pharma Ltd) at 37°C which shall be changed every 24 hours, until the next treatment.

 Regimen for sodium fluoride [(sodium fluoride I P– 50 mg (equivalent to 2,2600 ppm of fluoride) – Fluoritop-SR® Varnish: slow release topical dental fluoride– ICPA Health Products Ltd)] – One drop was taken each time and using an applicator brush, varnish was painted on the tooth surface.

 Regimen for catalase (enzymatic activity units/mg protein 2000.00-5000.00 Hi–Media Labs Pvt Ltd) included application for 3 minutes. Later was washed with deionized water and placed in respective vial containing artificial saliva.

Microhardness Testing
Microhardness measurements were made for control slabs (without any treatment so was considered as the baseline value of VHN) and experiment slabs after respective treatment. Slabs were positioned perpendicularly to the long axis of the indentor to record the Vicker’s hardness number (VHN). The individual testing of the enamel slabs was blinded and a 1 kg (max) load Vicker’s indentor was attached to a microhardness tester (Leica, VMHT 30 A, M/S Leica, Germany) which performed three measurements in 5 seconds to determine the VHN of each slab.

Scanning Electron Microscope
The individual testing of the enamel slabs was blinded and enamel surfaces were sputter coated with gold in a vacuum evaporator and photomicrographs of representative areas were taken at 2000× magnifications.

RESULTS
One way ANOVA test on intergroup comparison was applied which disclosed difference in hardness values both among different experimental groups and control group and suggested a highly significant p-value (p ≤ 0.0001). It is evident from the table that hardness values (Table 2) have decreased significantly in group B as compared to group A and increased significantly in group E as compared to group A.

After 5 days, specimens showed different surface morphology (Figs 2A to E). The enamel surface was unchanged on the unbleached specimen in group A. An eroded pattern was noted on the specimens in group B with narrow cracks and granular material in some areas. A thin fibrillar network pattern forms a covering of the entire surface hence, obscuring the underlying mild surface alterations in group C. Group D showed a corroded surface morphology with widespread erosions and a mutilayered appearance due to formation of globular structures and aggregations on the enamel surface. Group E shows a relatively smooth surface with tiny depressions all over. The surface morphologic changes in groups B and C were less distinct than those of groups D and E.

DISCUSSION
The greatest concern since whitening treatments began to be used is the damage that bleaching agents cause to dental tissues, particularly enamel. In confirmation with most similar studies reported in literature, detrimental demineralization and reduced microhardness of enamel was noted in the present study. The present study also evaluates the bleached enamel surface treated with cata-lase and topical fluoride.

Thirty-five percent CP brought about minor alterations in enamel surface in the form of expansion of the prism sheath and narrow gaps resembling cracks between crystals. These gaps were consistent with the organic components in enamel. Mc Guckin14 attributed to HP for an increase in porosity as well as extensive fattening in enamel describing an enamel pattern similar to type II etching pattern. Bitter15 underlined the importance of considering the effects of these changes on enamel integrity since, in long term, they would be the cause of abrasion or cusp fracture, particularly in teeth that have been restored or weakened by other dental treatment. Further, Lopes16 established in vitro that erosions in the enamel surface following dental bleaching did not produce a uniform pattern and their intensity varied depending on the sample. There was also an apparent increase in superficial porosity characterised by a greater quantity of tomes process pits that were observed on the samples. It is speculated that it is this factor that explains postbleaching tooth sensitivity. Indeed most bleaching agents are acidic, which is not favorable to enamel, dentin and cementum. Remineralization of bleached enamel is a conventional modality to cure post bleaching hypersensi-tivity. Artificial saliva was used in this study to simulate oral conditions however, its remineralizing potential is not equivalent to natural saliva in vivo. Fewer alterations are expected in vivo, due to buffer capacity of saliva. It is difficult to determine the clinical significance of the results from in vitro studies since calcium and phosphates available in saliva can potentially replenish the lost substance.17 When pH is under physiologic limit, part of the phosphorus and calcium particles are released and added to the ionic calcium and phosphorus reservoirs. Consequently, apatite from the enamel surface is protected against dissolution. However, one may recommend the use of artificial saliva consisting only inorganic calcium and phosphate components and devoid of any organic components which could have the potential of forming a protective salivary pellicle. Remineralization by saliva alone may not always be complete, leaving areas susceptible to further decalcification and plaque retention. Therefore, sodium fluoride a well known rehardening (remineralizing) agent. This remineralization process can be explained by fluoride incorporation to tooth structure, forming a calcium fluoride layer that increases hardness values. Fluoride can be weakly or strongly adsorbed at the crystal surface. If it is incorporated into the concentrated layer of ions in the immediate fluid surrounding the crystal, the fluoride is strongly held by the underlying calciumions during an acid challenge. Hence, fluoride at the crystal surface is important, whereas the composition of the underlying apatite will be relatively unimportant. It is also possible for the fluoride to replace hydroxyl ions in the crystal surface and be strongly chemisorbed. In this case, it gets extremely difficult for dissolution of that area of the crystal. An enamel crystal dissolves particularly if fluoride is incorporated in it or on it, this will release fluoride into the external fluid environment. The fluoride in solution will subsequently slow down demineralization. In this way, structurally incorporated fluoride can affect the demineralization process, provided the acid challenge is sufficient to dissolve some apatite with fluoride, but not so strong that only dissolution occurs. This will occur if fluoride is applied frequently to the tooth surface at concentrations low enough to diffuse into the enamel and also if there is a reasonably soluble fluoride form present either at the surface or in the subsurface of the enamel. Fluoride presents in the intercrystalline fluid will enhance this process dramatically. Normal levels of fluoride in whole saliva vary between approximately 0.01 and 0.05 ppm. Studies have indicated that levels as low as 0.1 ppm fuo-ride may be sufficient to enhance crystal growth.

Figs 2A to E After 5-day interval bleaching, antioxidant and remineralization treatment period, the specimens showed different surface morphology: (A) Unaltered enamel surface, (B) an eroded pattern was noted with narrow cracks and granular material in some areas, (C) thin fibrillar network pattern formed a covering of the entire surface hence obscuring the underlying mild surface alterations, (D) widespread erosions and a mutilayered appearance due to formation of globular structures and aggregations was seen and (E) a relatively smooth surface with tiny depressions all over

Fluoride in topical form has also been used. The proposed mechanism of action is the occlusion of dentinal tubules by fluoride precipitates. Calcium fluoride and fluorapatite are the major products deposited on the enamel and dentin surfaces after their exposure to high- and low-concentration topical fluoride vehicles respectively.18

Tooth sensitivity and reduced bond strength have also been attributed to deeper penetration of HP into dental tissues.1920 Reduction in bond strength is due to the residual oxygen, released from the bleaching agent, that interferes with the resin infiltration into the etched enamel or inhibits the polymerization of resin.21 Pre-treatment with antioxidant agent allows free radical polymerization of the adhesive resin to proceed without premature termination by restoring the altered redox potential of the oxidized bonding substrate thus, reversing the compromised bonding.22 Also in presence of peroxide, it has been shown that hydroxyl radicals in the apatite lattice are substituted by peroxide ions and produce peroxide-apatite. When peroxide ions decompose, substituted hydroxyl radicals re-enter the apatite lattice, resulting in elimination of the structural changes caused by the incorporation of peroxide ions.5 Rotstein23 investigated the efficacy of catalase following intracoronal bleaching and observed the total elimination of HP into the extraradicular medium after 3 minutes. This suggests that catalase also provides an appreciably short working time, thereby reducing chairside time.

It is speculated that reducing the residual HP (by the action of antioxidant agent–catalase) could reduce tooth sensitivity after first bleaching application. After final bleaching cycle, removal of HP would facilitate more fluoride uptake on the enamel surface. Carbamide peroxide also infuences enamel fluoride uptake. The reason being, in a wet or humid environment, CP is hydrolytically cleaved, thereby releasing peroxide.24 Peroxide will further decompose into radicals which act as the active bleaching agent. It might be speculated that these radicals interact with the fluoride of the gels or the enamel apatite reducing enamel fluoride acquisition or retention. Therefore, for fuoridation of the bleached enamel, instead of using a fuoridated bleaching agent, it could better be performed by a fluoride gel applied after bleaching. Specimens in group D showed a smoothened surface apart from some areas which give an eroded appearance. These eroded areas were areas where further remineralization was still needed, by either artificial saliva or sodium fluoride. Specimens bleached with 38% HP and then treated with Sodium fluoride appear to be comparatively much smoother than their CP counterpart.

Specimens bleached in group E and showed a smooth surface which gives an appearance somewhat similar to that of the control specimen. Tiny depressions of bubbles can be seen on the surface secondary to release of oxygen gas. These might be areas where a neutralizing reaction is still going on because of deeply penetrated HP and subsequently catalase.

CONCLUSION
Several conclusions have been drawn which highlight the effectiveness of usage of an antioxidant and a hardening agent post bleaching in order to restore the integrity of enamel in terms of remineralization, surface smoothness, hardness and surface hydration. Thirty-five percent CP produced irregularities on the enamel surface which was effectively remineralized by the additive and synergistic effect of catalase and sodium fluoride.

Introduction
The human ability to perceive and understand others actions, emotions, and intentions is pivotal to the formation of social interactions, communication, and relationships. At the neural level, studies have revealed a set of brain regions which are part of the action perception network or mirror system and which are particularly involved in human motion perception (Gallese et al., 2004; Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004; Rizzolatti and Fabbri-Destro, 2008). The existence of “mirror” neurons was first described in the macaque monkey brain using single-cell recordings (di Pellegrino et al., 1992). Later, neuroimaging and neurophysiological research confirmed the existence of a similar “fronto-parietal” mirror system in the human brain (Fadiga et al., 1995; Grafton et al., 1996; Iacoboni et al., 1999). In addition to the mirror-motor areas in the inferior parietal, inferior frontal gyrus and premotor cortex, the action perception network also encompasses higher-order visual areas in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) that convey visual input to downstream visuo-motor areas (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004; Caspers et al., 2010; Molenberghs et al., 2010, 2012). Especially the right pSTS has been highlighted as a key neural locus for perception of bodies and biological motion (Allison et al., 2000), as it has been shown to be particularly activated during the perception of eye or mouth movements, body language, and biological motion (Allison et al., 2000; Hein and Knight, 2008; Redcay, 2008; Carrington and Bailey, 2009).

Prior research most frequently adopted the so-called point-light displays (PLDs) to study the neural basis of biological movement perception as they represent a highly controllable, impoverished form of biological motion (Johansson, 1973). In these displays, only a few bright moving point-light dots are depicted against a dark background to represent the movement of the main joints of a human body. Although they lack any information on texture or form, PLDs are highly salient in depicting human actions as well as information on the gender or emotional state in which the point-light figure is engaged (Johansson, 1973; Cutting and Kozlowski, 1977; Dittrich et al., 1996; Pollick et al., 2002, 2005; Alaerts et al., 2011).

To date, two studies investigated the causal relationship between the ability to perceive PLDs and intact functioning of the (right) pSTS (Grossman et al., 2005; van Kemenade et al., 2012). In these studies, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to temporarily disrupt activity in right pSTS and both reported deteriorated performance on a task involving the detection of biological motion in noise-masked displays (Grossman et al., 2005; van Kemenade et al., 2012).

Here, we used a transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paradigm to investigate whether neural information processing can be up- or down-regulated in order to increase or deteriorate biological motion perception. Development of brain stimulation paradigms that can enhance biological motion perception abilities would be of particular interest for neuropsychiatric conditions that have clear implications in social and communicative domains, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). At the behavioral level, ASD-related deficiencies in biological motion perception have been reported repeatedly (Kaiser and Pelphrey, 2012) and also previous neuroimaging studies from our and other labs showed altered activity and connectivity patterns in pSTS regions in the autistic brain (Freitag et al., 1994; Pelphrey et al., 2011; Alaerts et al., 2014). Particularly tasks including an emotion processing component (e.g., reporting the emotional state of PLD figures) have shown highly consistent ASD-specific deficiencies (Hubert et al., 2007; Parron et al., 2008; Atkinson, 2009; Nackaerts et al., 2012; Alaerts et al., 2014).

In the present study, we applied tDCS with anodal (excitatory) or cathodal (inhibitory) electrodes mounted over right pSTS (target) and orbito-frontal cortex (reference) in healthy human subjects while they performed a bodily emotion recognition task using PLDs. Performance [accuracy and reaction times (RTs)] was also assessed on a control task that was matched to the emotion recognition task in terms of cognitive and motor demands. Each subject participated in two experimental sessions, receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation, separated by one week to avoid residual effects of previous stimulations. Based on previous studies and in the light of our anatomical hypothesis, we expected anodal (excitatory) stimulation over right pSTS to increase sensitivity to biological motion thereby enhancing emotion recognition abilities. Cathodal (inhibitory) tDCS over pSTS is expected to reduce or have no effect on performance.

Materials and Methods
Participants
Twenty-four subjects participated in the study (15 females, 22.35 ± 0.28 years). All participants were naive regarding the purpose of the experiments and were unfamiliar with PLDs. Subjects had no history of medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorders, and none of them were receiving acute or chronic medication affecting the central nervous system.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment. Consent forms and study design were approved by the local Ethics Committee for Biomedical Research at the KU Leuven in accordance to the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).

General procedure
All subjects received tDCS during the completion of a bodily emotion recognition task and a control task. They participated in two stimulation sessions where tDCS was applied with anodal (excitatory) or cathodal (inhibitory) electrodes mounted over the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) (target) and left orbito-frontal cortex (reference). Sessions were separated by one week to avoid residual effects of previous stimulations (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 Experimental protocol and experimental tasks. (A) visualizes the experimental protocol, consisting of two stimulation sessions separated by one week. At each session, participants received either anodal (excitatory) or cathodal (inhibitory) tDCS over the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The lower part of (A) represents a schematic presentation of the placement of the anodal/cathodal electrodes over the target (right pSTS) and reference region (left orbito-frontal area). (B) visualizes one trial of the experimental tasks. In the emotion recognition task, participants were instructed to indicate the emotional state of the blue-bordered PLD relative to the baseline yellow-bordered PLD (always showing a neutral emotional state). The same PLD-stimuli were presented in the control task matched for cognitive and motor demands. Here, one of the dots in the yellow-bordered PLD briefly changed color to either red or green. Subsequently, participants had to indicate the number of dots that changed into the same color in the blue-bordered PLD (2 in this example).

Prior to the first stimulation session, subjects were familiarized with task instructions and were allowed to practice the tasks. After a 30-min resting period, tDCS was administered while subjects performed alternating blocks of the emotion recognition task and the control task. Task performance was initiated 5 min after tDCS onset and lasted 8.5 min. TDCS was presented for 20 min to ensure that it was applied during the entire duration of the tasks. Half of the participants received anodal stimulation in the first stimulation session. The other half started with cathodal stimulation (Figure 1A).

Transcranial direct current stimulation
Transcranial direct current stimulation was delivered by an electrical constant direct current stimulator (HDC Stim, Newronika), which was connected to a pair of rectangular electrodes (25 cm2). The stimulating current was an anodal or cathodal constant current of 1.5 mA, delivered for 20 min. In the anodal condition, the anode was placed over right temporal lobe, targeting the posterior part of the STS and the cathode was placed over the left orbito-frontal area (see Figure 1A for a schematic presentation of the target and reference regions). In the cathodal condition, the placement of the two electrodes was reversed. A similar mild itching sensation was felt by the subjects from receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation such that subjects were blinded on the type of stimulation that was administered. The electrode over pSTS was covered with conducting gel [Zero-gel (ECG–EEG)] to improve conduction through the hair and scalp, the orbito-frontal electrode was covered with a conducting gel and inserted into a saline-soaked synthetic sponge to improve the conduction. Pilot work indicated that this procedure was optimal for ensuring that low impedance between the electrodes and the scalp was maintained over the course of the experiment.

To determine the position of the target electrode over the pSTS region, we used averaged pSTS scalp positions determined in four participants (two of which also participated in the actual study) (age range: 25–30 years; three males; one female) using a Visor neuronavigation system. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical brain images (Siemens 3T scanner) were collected for these four subjects using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence [MPRAGE; repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.98 ms, 1 mm × 1 mm × 1.1 mm voxels, field of view (FOV): 240 × 256, 160 sagittal slices]. Subsequently, the Visor neuronavigation system (Advanced Neuro Technology, the Netherlands) was used to localize the pSTS (defined by MNI coordinates x = 53, y = −53, z = 9) relative to the inion-nasion and the right ear tragus. The MNI coordinates were derived a priori and represent average coordinates of 12 studies reporting pSTS-activation during biological motion perception (Jastorff and Orban, 2009) (see Figure 1A for a schematic presentation).

Emotion recognition from point-light displays
In both of the administered tasks (emotion and control), stimuli consisted of moving PLDs of a male and female actor. Stimuli were based on motion capture data as previously described (Alaerts et al., 2011, 2014; Nackaerts et al., 2012). In short, 12 reflective markers, attached to the joints of the ankles, the knees, the hips, the wrists, the elbows, and the shoulders, were tracked using an eight-camera VICON system (capturing system measuring at 100Hz, Oxford Metrics, Oxford, UK) (Figure 1B). In the adopted movie files (duration 3 s), marker positions were visible as 12 moving white spheres on a black background from three different viewpoints [front view (0°), side view (90°), and intermediate view (45°)]. The moving dots subtended 11 × 12 degrees visual angle at an approximate viewing distance of 50 cm. Each dot subtended 0.25 degrees. The stimuli portrayed human actions (walking; jumping; kicking) that expressed four bodily emotional states: sadness, anger, happiness, or neutral.

In the emotion recognition task, each trial showed a yellow-bordered PLD, followed by a blue-bordered PLD (Figure 1B). Participants were asked to indicate as fast and accurate as possible whether the presented point-light figure in the blue-bordered movie moved in a different “emotional state” compared to the point-light figure in the yellow-bordered movie. The emotional state of the blue-bordered PLD could either be indicated as sadder, angrier, happier, or not different (neutral) from the yellow-bordered PLD which always showed a point-light figure in a neutral emotional state.

In the control task, participants had to indicate color changes in the point-lights. In the yellow-bordered PLD, one of the dots briefly (0.5 s) changed color to either “red” or “green” at a random time-point. Subsequently, participants had to indicate the number of dots (0–1–2–3) that changed into the same color in the blue-bordered PLD (Figure 1B).

Response options were displayed at the bottom of the screen, which corresponded to four response buttons on a response box. Participants always used the right index, middle, ring, and little finger for button pressing. TRs and accuracy rates were assessed using E-Prime software (Psychological Software Tools).

During practice, participants completed two blocks of the emotion recognition task, alternated with blocks of the control task. During each of the stimulation sessions (anodal/cathodal), subjects performed five blocks of the emotion recognition task, alternated with blocks of the control task. Each block consisted of five trials, such that 25 responses were collected for each task within each testing session. In each trial, the (blue-bordered) PLD expressed one of four bodily emotional states: anger (seven trials), happiness (six trials), sadness (six trials), and neutral (six trials).

Data analysis and statistics
For each task, the correct RT and percentage correct answers (accuracy) were assessed for each stimulation condition (anodal, cathodal over pSTS), and a single inverse efficiency index (IEI) was calculated by dividing the RT scores by accuracy (RT/accuracy).

Effects of tDCS stimulation on task performance were analyzed by conducting a 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA analysis with “stimulation” (anodal, cathodal over pSTS) and “task” (emotion, control) as within-subject factors.

To assess the possibility of learning effects on task performance (irrespective of stimulation type), a similar 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA analysis was performed with “session” (session 1, session 2) and “task” (emotion, control) as within-subject factors.

The level of significance was set at a p-value of.05.

Statistica 10.0 (StatSoft. Inc., Tulsa, USA) was used for statistical analyses.

Results
Effects of tDCS
The main 2 × 2 repeated ANOVA analysis on the IEI (RT/accuracy) revealed no significant main effect of stimulation [F(1, 23) = 0.04, p = 0.84] or “task × stimulation” interaction [F(1, 23) = 0.93, p = 0.35], indicating that tDCS has no overall effect on task performance of the emotion task or control task (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Effects of tDCS on the emotion and control task. Figure 2 visualizes task performance [inverse efficiency index (RT/accuracy)] on the emotion and control task while participants received anodal (excitatory) (black circles) or cathodal (inhibitory) tDCS over pSTS (gray squares). Main analyses showed no effects of stimulation on the emotion or control task. Vertical bars denote standard errors. NS, not significant.

To check for more subtle and specific effects of stimulation, an exploratory 2 × 2 × 4 ANOVA analysis was conducted, additionally including the factor “emotion category” (neutral, happy, sad, angry). The “task × stimulation × emotion category” three-way interaction showed a non-significant trend [F(3, 69) = 2.35, p = 0.08], tentatively indicating that stimulation effects modulated differently depending on emotion category and task. Particularly, as visualized in Figure 3 (left panel), tDCS tended to exert a differential effect on recognizing the sad and angry emotional states (i.e., emotions with “negative emotional valence”), as compared to recognizing the happy and neutral emotional states. To further explore a possible contribution of “negative emotional valence,” a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA analysis was conducted with the factors “task” (emotion, control), “stimulation” (anodal, cathodal over pSTS), and “emotional valence,” directly contrasting “negative emotional valence” stimuli (sad and angry combined) with “non-negative” valence stimuli (happy and neutral combined). This exploratory ANOVA analysis confirmed that effects of stimulation were significantly modulated by emotional valence at least for the emotion task, not for the control task (significant “task × stimulation × emotional valence” three-way interaction [F(1, 23) = 7.67, p = 0.01]). Particularly, for recognition of the “negative valence” stimuli (angry–sad), performance was significantly higher (lower IEI) in the pSTS-anodal (excitatory), compared to the pSTS-cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation session [F(1, 23) = 6.62, p = 0.03, p-value Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons], whereas for recognizing emotional states with a “non-negative” positive–neutral emotional valence, no significant effect of stimulation was revealed [F(1, 23) = 2.18, p = 0.31, corrected].

Figure 3 visualizes task performance [inverse efficiency index (IEI) (RT/accuracy)] on the emotion and control task while participants received anodal (excitatory) (black circles) or cathodal (inhibitory) tDCS over pSTS (gray squares). Exploratory analysis indicated that for the emotion task, not for the control task, effects of stimulation are modulated by emotion type. Vertical bars denote standard errors.

Overall, a similar modulation of performance was revealed for the accuracy and RT measures separately (visualized in Figure S1 in Supplementary Material).

Learning effects
No general learning effects were revealed on the emotion or control task indicating that overall performance (across different emotion types) did not increase from session 1 to session 2 [F(1, 23) = 1.66, p = 0.21]. Also no “task × session” interaction was revealed [F(1, 23) = 1.9, p = 0.18]. However, a significant “task × session × emotion type” three-way interaction [F(3, 69) = 3.69, p = 0.02] indicated that session effects modulated differently depending on emotion type and task.

As seen in Figure 4 (right panel), performance on the control test tended to be higher in session 1 compared to session 2, but for none of the emotion categories, these differences reached significance after correction for multiple comparisons [all, p > 0.05, corrected]. Also for performance on the emotion task, no significant effects of session were revealed for any of the emotion categories [all, p > 0.05, corrected] (Figure 4, left panel).

Figure 4 Learning effects visualized separately for each emotion category (neutral, happy, sad, and angry). Figure 4 visualizes task performance [inverse efficiency index (RT/accuracy)] on the emotion and control task on session 1 (black open circles) and session 2 (gray open squares). No significant learning (session-) effects were revealed on the emotion or control task. Vertical bars denote standard errors.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the role of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in emotion recognition from PLDs. To do so, tDCS was applied using anodal (excitatory) or cathodal (inhibitory) electrodes mounted over right pSTS (target) and orbito-frontal cortex (reference) in two separate sessions. Half of the subjects received anodal stimulation over pSTS on the first session, the other half started with cathodal stimulation over pSTS with at least one week in-between.

Based on our primary analysis, we found no evidence that general emotion recognition from PLDs was affected by receiving anodal or cathodal stimulation over pSTS. However, exploratory analyses provided indications that effects of stimulation were dependent on the emotional valence of the presented stimuli. Particularly, when effects of stimulation were explored separately for emotion categories with a “negative” (sadness–anger) or “positive–neutral” (happy, neutral) emotional valence, it was revealed that performance scores for recognizing emotional states with a negative emotional valence significantly increased from receiving anodal (excitatory) stimulation compared to cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation over pSTS, whereas no stimulation effects were shown for recognizing emotional states with a positive–neutral emotional valence. No effects of stimulation were revealed for performance on the control task. Although effects are preliminary, these results provide first indications that tDCS stimulation over pSTS can modulate (negative) bodily emotion recognition from PLDs.

While anodal/cathodal tDCS was targeted over the pSTS, reference electrodes were placed over left orbito-frontal cortex. Similar supra-orbital reference placements have been adopted previously in studies from our (Zhang et al., 2014) and other (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000) labs targeting primary motor cortex to constrain stimulation effects to frontal areas. In our study, it is likely that tDCS affected excitability in orbito-frontal and prefrontal cortex, thereby modulating excitability in a large fronto-temporal network, potentially overlapping with the mentalizing network or social brain [e.g., Allison et al. (2000)]. In depressed patients, excitability-enhancing tDCS over dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to improve performance in an affective go-no-go task for positive emotional content (Boggio et al., 2007). Also in healthy participants, prefrontal tDCS has been shown to diminish emotional valence of unpleasant pictures (Boggio et al., 2009; Maeoka et al., 2012) or subtly improve emotional face identification (Nitsche et al., 2012) [but see Plazier et al. (2012)]. Future experiments are warranted to formally assess whether reference electrode placement to areas other than orbito-frontal sites may qualitatively alter the reported effects. Also other procedures can be adopted to increase focality and stimulation efficacy to the targeted region, such as high-definition tDCS using a 4 × 1 electrode placement (constraining current flow to a circumscribed area of four reference electrodes surrounding the target electrode).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects of anodal/cathodal tDCS over the posterior STS. In the past, two studies have applied rTMS over the pSTS region during perception of PLDs. In one study, Grossman et al. (2005) applied rTMS over right pSTS and subsequently measured sensitivity to biological motion. The task required subjects to recognize canonical (upright) point-light animations and 180° inverted animations. Here, rTMS resulted in a decreased sensitivity for recognizing upright biological motions, but stimulation did not affect performances for recognizing the inverted animations (Grossman et al., 2005). In another study by van Kemenade et al. (2012), TMS was applied over the left pSTS, the ventral premotor cortex and the vertex (control site). The task involved the recognition of PLDs of human animations masked in noise from scrambled versions of the same stimuli and performances were measured before and after 20 s of continuous theta burst stimulation of premotor, pSTS, and the control site (each tested on different days). Here, authors reported a significant decrease in detection of human PLDs when disrupting the premotor cortex and a marginally significant decrease in detection when left pSTS was stimulated (van Kemenade et al., 2012).

While Grossman et al. (2005) and van Kemenade et al. (2012) used PLDs to assess effects of rTMS over pSTS, other studies used different task paradigms to assess the role of STS in emotion or motion processing. For example, Pitcher (2014) measured the effects of rTMS over right STS during the recognition of facial emotional expressions and found that repetitive TMS specifically deteriorated performance on the facial emotion recognition task, not on a matched control task requiring the identification of faces. Another study applied rTMS over left STS during action observation, and showed that the “mapping” of observed “implied” actions onto the observer’s motor system (as measured by changes in cortico-motor excitability in primary motor cortex) was enhanced from stimulating left STS (Avenanti et al., 2013).

More recently, Arfeller et al. (2013) used fMRI to explore changes in the functional connections of left and right pSTS after application of rTMS. Interestingly, brain regions showing changes were identified in lateral temporo-occipital cortex, the anterior intraparietal region and in the ventral premotor cortex. Considering that these are all regions of the action perception or “mirror” network, the authors concluded that STS plays a pivotal relay position during the observation of others movements (Arfeller et al., 2013). This notion conforms to findings from an earlier lesion study showing that lesions in superior temporal and premotor areas have causal relationships to deficits in biological motion perception (Saygin, 2007).

In the present study, tDCS stimulation mildly affected emotion recognition from PLDs, at least for emotional states with a “negative” emotional valence. One study similarly showed that tDCS over the cerebellum specifically affected recognition of negative facial emotions (anger, sadness), not of positive or neutral faces (Ferrucci et al., 2012). A selective effect for negative emotional stimuli was also reported in a study by Candidi et al. (2011), showing that rTMS over right pSTS specifically deteriorated the detection of threatening human body postures, not the detection of neutral postures (Candidi et al., 2011). Also repetitive TMS over the frontal sensorimotor system specifically interfered with the recognition of faces expressing anger and fear, not happy or neutral faces (Balconi and Bortolotti, 2012). Several studies on emotional face processes indicated that distinct emotions may be processed differently. For example, by using the “face-in-the-crowd” paradigm, Ohman et al. (2001) showed that among faces expressing various emotions, a face expressing anger was processed faster and more accurately than other facial expressions (Ohman et al., 2001). Also for PLDs, an increase in visual sensitivity has been demonstrated for detecting angry walkers (Chouchourelou et al., 2006). Another study showed that the detection of human gait in PLD biological motion correlated with the detection of angry point-light figures, but not happy figures (Ikeda and Watanabe, 2009). It has been proposed that threatening stimuli may be processed more automatically thereby explaining the higher sensitivity to anger in these previous studies. Specifically, the “threat advantage hypothesis” suggests that natural selection resulted in a propensity to react more strongly and automatically to negative than to positive stimuli (Fox et al., 2000). In relation to our study, it can be speculated that tDCS over right pSTS predominantly affected the automatic processing of emotional states, hence the specificity for emotional states with negative emotional valence. However, considering that the present experiment was not a priori designed to disentangle the differential effect of stimulation on processing negative/positive–neutral emotional states (limited number of trials for each emotion category), future studies, specifically testing stimulation effects on distinct emotion categories, are warranted to be conclusive on this interpretation.

In our experiment, only the right, not the left pSTS, area was disrupted or stimulated. The suggestion of right hemisphere specialization for processing facial or other non-verbal social cues knows a long history and is based on several clinical observations and neuroimaging studies (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009). Also a very recent study confirmed the notion of right lateralization for perceiving emotional dynamic faces in human pSTS (De Winter et al., 2015). Nevertheless, compensatory contributions of left pSTS or other fronto-parietal regions (e.g., premotor cortex) cannot be ruled out. For example, one study, examining effects of rTMS stimulation over left and right superior temporal lobe, showed that stimulation over both hemispheres can increase attention selectively for angry faces (not for fearful or neutral faces) (Brüne et al., 2006). The latter study therefore indicates that not only right but also left pSTS may play an important role in directing and processing of negative emotional states such as anger. Interestingly, the study by Brüne et al. additionally showed that right hemisphere stimulation more strongly affected processing of male angry faces, whereas right hemisphere stimulation more strongly affected processing of female angry faces. Although preliminary, the authors suggested that this hemispheric specialization might reflect a divergent significance for processing male and female threat (Brüne et al., 2006).

One limitation of this study is the lack of a sham condition (during which no stimulation is applied). Future research is therefore necessary to firmly disentangle whether anodal/cathodal stimulation increased/decreased performance compared to baseline for detecting emotional states with negative emotional valence. Also for the emotion conditions and control task where stimulation showed no effects on performance, a baseline condition is necessary to formally exclude the possibility that anodal and cathodal produced a uniform effect on performance (e.g., both increasing or deteriorating performance). Indeed, in a recent study examining effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS over left primary motor cortex, it was shown that anodal and cathodal tDCS, when applied at similar intensities and duration, can produce similar changes in cortico-motor excitability (Batsikadze et al., 2013).

In summary, the present study found no overall effect of tDCS brain stimulation on bodily emotion recognition from PLDs. However, when emotion categories were explored separately, a significant effect of stimulation was revealed for recognizing emotional states with a negative emotional valence (sadness and anger), as indicated by higher performance during anodal (excitatory) stimulation, compared to cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation over pSTS. This finding partly agrees with previous studies showing structure–function relationships between STS and biological motion processing from PLDs and provides indications that stimulation effects may be modulated by the emotional valence of the stimuli.
